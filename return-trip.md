# the return trip

here i will describe the trip i took from south korea (ICN) back to united states (LGA). i booked my Korea-to-USA plane ticket(s) when i was still in Taiwan because i supposed that they would ask me for some 'proof of onwards flight' or sth when flying from Taiwan to Korea. they kind of did, but they basically just asked me 'do u have a flight out of south korea' or sth, and i said yes, and i dont think..? they even checked? if i actually had one? idk. any ways.

My ticket(s) from south korea to usa was more expensive than my (effectively direct flight) from usa to japan, Plus i had Two Layovers. the first layover was: san francisco international airport (SFO).

## ICN to SFO
I sat on the plane to SFO. i was the middlest column of the plane; seat arrangements were like AAA A(me)A AAA; a row of nine seats with two aisles.

I was not really expecting to receive much Foods because i was on United Airlines which i looked up and i thought i saw that u had to pay to receive food or sth??even on long flights?? idk. However, they served approx Four foods, all apparently free:

1. pretzels snack mix
2. a Meal, which u could chose Beef or Chicken
3. a little sandwich and cookie i think
4. a breakfast sandwich and pastry

![9.23 17:43 GMT+9: pretzels snack mix. i initially was going to save them for later but then drink cart came around i got a Beer ate the Pretzels with Beer. i got a Beer because i saw someone else requested a Beer and received a whole can of stella artois which is branded really cooly so i wanted one as well but i got a 'michelob ultra' which was...idk did not taste like much and also the packaging is not very cool.](pics/20230923_174307.jpg)

![9.23 18:13 GMT+9: here is the Meal. i got Beef. honestly not bad pretty yummy except maybe the Bread which was um kind of cold and hard. it came with a pat of butter. i thought: what if i take a bite of the pat of butter? so i did. it just tasted like butter. also i think the drink cart came by and i received a little cup of red wine. the cabin attendant asked me 'ur over 21 right?' (in a friendly way) and i replied yes , and they said 'you look young' (in a friendly way). thanks cabin attendant haha;](pics/20230923_181312.jpg)

![9.23 21:53 GMT+9: little sandwich and cookie. i saved mine for later](pics/20230923_215329.jpg)

![9.23 21:59 GMT+9: drink cart came by and i got ginger ale. they gave me the whole can! nice (i guess)](pics/20230923_215921.jpg)

![9.24 02:05 GMT+9: breakfast sand and pastry. pastry was cold and hard](pics/20230924_020529.jpg)

besides the foods, on the plane i probably played around shortly on the digital panel on the back of seat, randomly looked around plane, took a few little naps maybe, and ofc had to use restroom. the guy on my right was either sleeping or just didnt see me or just didnt care when i looked like i needed to get up out. so i turned to my left tried to get up out and that person got up for me. thanks that person!. they even get up in advance when they see me coming back to seat. we are already practically besties.

## the bay area
eventually we arrived in sand francisco international airport. i got out the plane. i was expecting i can just stay within the gates or sth?? and wait for my next flight ? but, reading the signs it seemed like i couldnt do that, maybe bc i was an international flight.

![9.23 11:27 GMT-7: sand francisco airport. as you can see i think you must exit. btw that little green exit icon i seen all over the place in east-asia showing u where u can exit. but in usa i think i only have seen it like twice: once here and once in new york city large train hall station. idk why exit signs, esp standardised exit signs seem so rare in usa. maybe im just dont remember them.](pics/20230924_032721.jpg)

i walked through stuff and found myself Outside The Gates. oops!. i walked around the airport looking for a comfortable place to sit and charge phone. tbh i dont really find one; all the seats dont have convenient outlet. eventually i just sit down anyways use phone.

Using phone i mentioned to a friend that lives kind of (not really) in the area that i am san francisco airport. i do not expect them to want to meet because they live kind of far imo and Stuff , but then they say let's hang out bro. so, it was set to Hang Out bro.

it was planned to meet at Stanford University, however based on predicted trip times said by Google , meet at Stanford University would take a bit too long and we only had Limited Time because i had to go back to Airport at night. So, we agreed to meet at 'san mateo'. tbh i think we may could have meet at stanford university in a timely manner if i had Taken A Rideshare, however

1. a Rideshare would have cost USD40, which is hilarious bc thats more expensive than
	- a motel and two meals in south korea
	- or, two good meals in usa, even in expensive parts of the country
	- also, USD40 is only like 5 USD less than i spent on my south-korean transportation card in my 11-day trip (includes every subway ride i ever took + local buses).
2. i hate rideshare bc its awkward ur just sitting alone in a car with one other person
3. i hate rideshare conceptually because its controlled by like two companies in total and just reinforces car culture which has already gone too far

So, i went to take Trains to San Mateo. im sorry my friend who took rideshare a little farther to san mateo rather than stanford. they said the difference between the two rides wasnt much and they was going to rideshare anyways but idk if they was just saying that to be polite.

The first train i had to take was the 'bay-area rapid transit (BART)', a single stop from SFO to Millbrae. a one-way ticket cost USD5 or maybe even USD5.5 i think??????????? which was wild coming from east-asia where:

- a one-stop train ride would cost the equivalent of 1 USD, or max like 2 USD. Even if u dont use absolute currency conversions and judge ticket prices in terms of like the price of a meal, i would say japan and korea the ticket would cost like 1/8th of a meal. and this BART train would cost u like 1/3rd of a meal (ok actually maybe like 1/4th because u have to pay TAX and TIPS lol. but still expensive).
- you can probably literally just walk the distance of one train stop. but looking up walking directions from SFO to Millbrae train station it would take a 6-min car ride but a 2hour 10min walk??? because you have to walk around a bunch of highways or sth????? bro what ?? i guess because its an airport theyre not expecting u to just walk in? but still bro 2 hours??

anyways i took the train in the direction of millbrae, and it passed by millbrae. because i needed a special train that stops at millbrae?? it wasnt even like a express/local train distinction, just whether the train stops at millbrae? what? idk bro and i dont even want to k it gave me a headache i was already p*ssed for paying 5 dollars for a one-way subway ticket travelling one stop

eventually after taking trains back and forth i arrived at millbrae. and went over to the appropriate 'caltrain' platform. there were no gates or anything ; you just bought a ticket and boarded and i guess they do random checks. according to the caltrain website i think i paid USD3.75 for a one-way ticket. i was pleasantly pleased with this not-expensive-af ticket price.

however on the platform i was informed by the digital train-schedule sign thing that the trains only ran once every ONE HOUR which was wild. they said it was bc some train had problems or sth, but i looked at the regular schedule and i think it said the trains only ran every like 30 mins or so?? which is weird i thought the 'bay area' was like famous and expensive bc lots of ppl live there..? i guess they just drive..?

![9.23 14:17 GMT-7: train that comes every 1 hour](pics/20230923_141743.jpg)

eventually , a giant-ass train like two stories high looking like its about to drive through siberia arrive. i board, ride it to san mateo. get off.

![9.23 16:35 GMT-7: this is what the train looked like. video of train taken later in san mateo when saw it crossing a road.](pics/20230923_163507.webm)

![9.23 14:43 GMT-7: this was the san mateo train 'station'. its just like a sidewalk..that is next to the tracks..i mean its not bad , its kind of cute.even quaint. but i guess i was expecting more or sth.](pics/20230923_144329.jpg)

at this point i need to use bathroom very urgently. my Friend not arrived yet , i walked to some grocery store i looked up on google maps that looked like it might have a bathroom. luckily it did , and i used that , and i came out , and friend was there.

We walked through 'downtown' san mateo. If you look up 'san mateo' on wikipedia, it says this: "San Mateo has one of the larger, better-developed suburban downtowns in the San Francisco Bay Area." it basically felt like that. i was expecting something more like.. idk mentally stimulating?. but it was just.. idk a suburban downtown. everything was quite spread apart, and it was kind of empty.

we walked to a park and walked around the park. the park was nice. there was a swing set i swung on a swing it was nice.

![9.23 15:35 GMT-7: some plant that was in/around/associated with the park](pics/20230923_153542.jpg)

![9.23 ??? GMT-7: garden in/at/around/associated with the park. picture taken by Friend](pics/park-not-me.webp)

then , we walked to go eat something. however , neither of us knew what want to eat. so, discussed a long time just walk around. try rock-paper-scissors decide on what type of food to eat or so. it didnt work still dont know what to eat.

![9.23 16:13 GMT-7: a dove](pics/20230923_161322.jpg)

eventually at some point i just say 'lets go to taco bell bro' and friend say: 'ok', so we walking to taco bell, but then we pass a vietnamese restaurant that we was originally thinking about going to but for some reason just didnt go bc indecision. It smelled very good and i say lets eat here so we ate here.

originally we ordered like two appetizer and two rice-noodle-soup. however it turns out the appetizers was kinda actually big like each could feed one person a meal. they were very tasty. and when the rice-noodle-soup came out, they (thankfully) messed up our order only gave us One.

![9.23 17:09 GMT-7: here was a mid-meal photo of appetizers. already fully ate one of the appetizers. they was very tasty. and fulfilling. maybe top1 vietnamese food i have eaten in life, though tbh ive not eaten a ton of vietnmaese food and only have eaten it in usa.](pics/20230923_170946.jpg)

![9.23 17:32 GMT-7: half-eaten soup. friend said it was very good, i personally did not really think it was exceptional but maybe bc i liked the appetizers already. however it was still very yummy.](pics/20230923_173233.jpg)

overall it was surprisingly good value; i think appetizers were both around USD10 and the big soup was umm idk around USD12(?????) or so. i was expecting everything around 'bay area' to be a gazillion dollars but here was nice. after a short argument about who should pay, friend forcefully paid using the classic 'you pay next time'. as a form of compensation i gave them a crisp KRW1000 bill and a golden squeaky chicken that i got from gacha machine in japan but the keychain thing broke off somewhere in korea.

Walk back to train 'station' wait for train. train come i say bye bye i go on train ride back to Millbrae and take BART back to SFO.

![9.23 18:14 GMT-7: heres inside of caltrain i took. im sitting on second floor. idk why theres a luggage rack and giant empty space in middle.](pics/20230923_181428.jpg)

![9.23 18:14 GMT-7: beautiful sun out the dirty window looking to lovely parking lot (caltrain)](pics/20230923_181432.jpg)

at SFO, my gate for flight was not assigned until like idk 2 hours or an hour before flight idk i just remember print out boarding pass (at a self kiosk) and gate not assigned. huh? i walked around wondering how im supposed to know which security to go through because i think diff security goes to diff gates(?idk). eventually after a while i went back to self kiosk, re-printed boarding pass, and it has the gate on it. and i go through security, wait plane, board. the end.

## SFO to IAD

my second out of three flights was across the usa from sand francisco to dulles Virginia usa. tbh i dont really remember much about this flight. i sat in an aisle seat. i probably took some little naps. idk.

## dulles, va (IAD)

i arrived IAD , and discovered i could just walk around the gates dont have to go through security again unlike SFO. very nice. My layover was only 2 hours, so i just found my way over to my Next Flight Gate. eat leftover sandwich from ICN->SFO flight. however then they change the Gate. however the new Gate was just across the room 4m away. so all chill. but then they changed the Gate again where i have to take a little train to it. but i got there.

![9.24 06:11 GMT-4: iad](pics/20230924_061152.jpg)

## IAD to LGA
this flight my last flight i remember the plane felt so itty bitty so cute compared to the other planes i took. each row was only four seats divided by middle aisle. and most of seats was empty. i saw person near me just lie down across they seats take a little nap. also funny story , during takeoff someone came over sat in seat in front of me, probably bc there was just so many seats u could move around as u pleased. but that person i Saw on my flight from ICN->SFO standing out the bathroom or so with they friend. i remembered them distinctive Look , tall and long hair and stuff. interesting experience. the flight was quite short. or at least it felt so after taking 5 hour and 5+ hour flights. soon, landed at LaGuardia airport (LGA).

## new york city
i got off the plane and exit airport. theres a free bus to jackson heights or Woodside. i got off at Woodside. then, i continued the rest of my life. the end. END OF TRIP
