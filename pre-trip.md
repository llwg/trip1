# pre-trip

## background

My father said to me this year or so that I and mine sister can go to Taiwan for a little trip, because father had some business to attend to in Taiwan, and sister and I have never visited Taiwan. I first thought that I would go. Then I thought I would not go because I was suffering from searching for employment. But then it looked that I was going to find employment soon, so I thought: ok maybe I should go to Taiwan. And since I take expensive plane to East Asia, Why not simply visit more of East Asia? So I decided to take trip to East Asia. I was not exactly sure where and when to go there. But I had intention to do it.

## trip planning

My father already planned out they would be in Taiwan for about a week at start of september. So that part of my trip was set ; i would just follow them around bc they knew the local languages and culture well. In addition to Taiwan, i wished to visit Japan and South Korea.

It was about 23 August at this time. and, I predicted that i would need to return to USA due to employment around 23 Sep. So, I figured that the best plan would to go to Japan or South Korea Now, spend 10 or so days , go to Taiwan , spend the fixed time There, go to The Remaining country After Taiwan , spend 10 or so days There.

I didnt really know to visit Japan or Korea first. idked. However, eventually i booked flight to Japan. It was actually a flight to Indonesia with layover in Japan (JFK -> HND, NRT -> CGK), but i figured i could just Not Take the second flight (i googled it and nothing said it was explicitly illegal or anything) , and in this sense it was basically just discount Direct Flight to japan.

It was then 23 August, and mine flight was scheduled to be 26th of August at 1:10AM. so essentially 25th of august 25:10. how exciting!

## trip preparation

on the 24th i prepared for the trip by going around and shopping for A Bag to hold my belongings as i traveled. however all the bags i saw were kinda expensive or just didnt look feel right so i simply did not buy a bag. i also bought some fruits and vegetable juice to drink before trip because my health did not feel 100% it was more like 85%. so i drank them hoping the nutrition would nourish my body to health before trip or something. I also tried clean stuff up in the apartment i resided in which belonged not to me, so it was necessary to clean mine things up.

on the 25th i prepared for the trip by doing laundry and packing laundry and other items for trip. i also shaved my head. here is a list of what i packed:

- five extra pairs of innerwear (1 pair = 1 underpants, 1 tshirt)
- one extra pair of socks
- a towel (34x78cm and thin)
- a hand towel/handkercjiehif
- epinephrine injector
- albuterol inhaler
- plastic teeth retainer
- a few tablets of um this allergy drug thing
- nail clipper and ear swabs in altoids (candy) tin
- 25W usb-c charging thing
- usb C to C charging cable
- usb A to lightning cable
- one of those little sim tool things
- 14-inch laptop
- portable SSD and two little cables
- wired earphones with usb C to 3.55mm convertor
- USD money bills
- two masks
- my USA-relevant keys
- my passport
- my wallet with credit card n things
- picture frame with picture of duck and my vaccination card contained

unfortunately i do not have a picture of this original packing, but a picture of a similarish packing can be seen in <a href='taiwan.html#taiwan-day-7-taipei'>taiwan/day 7</a>.

i packed all these things in a 99-cent reusable grocery bag that i accidentally got when a grocery checkout person asked me if i wanted a paper or plastic bag and i said plastic expecting they were going to give me those thin plastic bags but they gave me a nice thick reusable grocery bag. small items i put in a large plastic freezer bag (idk exact capacity).

![8.29 10:27 GMT+9: here is my setup later in japan, probably with extra random plastic bag and flyers in it. also my shoes i wore through entire trip.](pics/20230829_102753.jpg)

I Was Packed and ready to go. How Exciting!

## usa
I began my journey in USA New York City taking the A Train bound for Far Rockaway in order to go to the JFK airport. there was actually some service announcements that day that confused me and i transfered around trains probably unnecessarily. i think there were just not many Far Rockaway A Trains at that time. But eventually i arrived at the JFK A Train station.

![8.25 21:15 GMT-4: sparsely running A train. this picture is of The Station (Howard Beach JFK Airport) i think, right after i got off the train.](pics/20230825_211459.jpg)

JFK has a special 'airtrain' = little train that transports people between main NewYorkCity subway , parking lots, and airport terminals. what makes it special is u have to pay USD 8.25 to enter it at a station that connects to NewYorkCity subway.

![8.25 21:16 GMT-4: This the entrance to JFK airtrain from HOWARD BEACH JFK AIRPORT newyorkcity subway station.](pics/20230825_211618.jpg)

but any other station u dont have to pay to get on. Why?idk. however i didnt want to pay USD 8.25. So i simply walked to an AirTrain station that was not connected to NewYorkCity subway station. Looking briefly at google maps and looking stuff up, i thought i could potentially just walk through a giant parking lot or something. But in my experience there were giant walls around the parking lot ?? or i just got lost?? so i walked around a lot of things

![8.25 21:20 GMT-4: walking from subway to nonpaid airtrain station. weird giant walls on right side.](pics/20230825_212040.jpg)

![how i got to JFK](pics/JFKAIRTRAIIIN.png)

eventually i got there. this was my first time to airport alone , i think. I did not really know if I knew what I was doing. Here was my workflow for airport:

1. "check in" to flight. this was done by walking up to my airline (Japan Airlines) and then looking at the signs to see what seemed right, then walking up to the person. then I think I just looked at them or something because idrk what to did? or idk, and then they probably did something like ask me "are you checking in?" or "can i see your passport" or something. and then i gave them my passport, and they did stuff, and maybe asked me some kind of questions like u dont have any baggage to check in right?, and then they gave me boarding passes.
2. GO THROUGH AIRPORT SECURITY (for the appropriate gate). this involved throwing away my plastic bottle of water. then standing in a line where someone checks ur boarding pass (and passport i think?). then u go through a line where u put ur stuff in a bin and then it goes thru xray machine. and then YOU have to go through an xray machine. except i learned from mom who is paranoid about a lot of health things that u can just get "pat down" (I have also heard it called an "opt-out") where instead of going through the XRAY MACHINE some person rubs u with gloves and put gloves in a machine or something. there was also a guy yelling stuff along the lines of hurry up, take ur shoes off, empty ur pockets, stand in a line, idk something like that. but he was chill when i asked can i get a pat down and i got pat down and successfully WENT THROUGH AIRPORT SECURITY.
3. WAIT FOR BOARDING. this involved sitting in a waiting area and waiting to get on plane. while I sat in waiting area i became cold, real chilly and shivering. because airport aircondition was quite strong i think.
4. RIDE THE PLANE. this involves boarding the plane. they checked boarding ticket and passport. and i got on the plane.

## JFK to HND

i was now on my discount direct flight to tokyo haneda airport :). i pre-selected a window seat which was nice bc i can look out the window. But what was not nice was there was someone between me and getting out of seat to use bathroom. and there were also free rows behind me i think but idk i already sat down and idk if i can just switch my seat mid-flight. So it was a bit unfortunate. Needing to use the bathroom but having to get the other person to move was a bit of a source of anxiety for me.

The flight was essentially sit down for 14 hours in seat and eat. i also watched the japanese animation Suzume about earthquakes on the in-flight back of seat thing. The flight served four foods which can be found described below in the picture captions.

![8.26 02:20 GMT-4: first food. a sandWich, fruit cup, biscuits, and potato crisps, and a small bottle of water. served immediately after takeoff.](pics/20230826_022035.jpg)

![8.26 10:06 GMT-4: second food. served halfway thru flight. rice crackers and drink of choice. i requested red wine i was fascinated that they serve free alcohol on planes. it came in tiny cute plastic bottle. not pictured but they gave me plastic cup to pour it into also. i am no wine smeller but it tasted like red wine.](pics/20230826_100650.jpg)

![8.26 10:43 GMT-4: third food. served shortly after second food snack. a full meal. could choose between some kind of beef or chicken dish. i chose beef. beef and rice thing came warm covered in foil. various cold side dish and salad (and dressing). very tasty imo. i like potato salad. came with another small water. also another drink of choice i chose beer. yum food!](pics/20230826_104357.jpg)

![8.26 14:51 GMT-4: four food. potato snack. served a bit before landing ish.](pics/20230826_145120.jpg)

i also slept probably for a few hours um i dont really remember though.
