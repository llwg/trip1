<h1 id="taiwan">taiwan</h1>
<p>i spent 7 days in Taiwan because my Father was going to be in Taiwan
during that time , and i could just stay with him (and his brother
i.e. my uncle). This trip ended up basically just being me following
them around. i did not have much creative input in the Trip (maybe i
Could have if i had said something, but i did not say anything).</p>
<p>Because I didn’t have much creative say in the trip, i kind of do not
feel much Excitement trying to Recall all the Details. The details also
involves details about Family Members which I don’t feel comfortable
writing onto the Internet. So, I will describe my Trip in Taiwan very
Generally.</p>
<h2 id="taiwan-day-1-taipei">taiwan day 1 – taipei</h2>
<p>on the Plane to Taiwan i ate a Rice ball i bought in KIX and then was
gonna drink some Tea but then a cabin attendant stopped me and said
something in (i think) mandarin, which i had no clue bc i know like 3
words of mandarin. i looked confused and then they said “japanese?” and
i replied “english” and then they told me in english that i cant eat
outside food, or bring it on in the first place(?). oops!. so i did not
drink my tea.</p>
<p>plane arrived in Taiwan (TPE) at 10Something AM. i ate my remaining
rice ball and drank Tea when arrived. Father met me at the Airport and
gave me a Transportation/IC card that he bought for me ahead of time.
thanks dad!. We took train back to the ‘AirBnB’ (AirBnB = to my
understanding, Person Rents out their Spare Properties via App, lol)
that my Dad and Uncle staying in in Taipei City. i should have not
dranken as much tea as i did in airport bc the train ride was long.</p>
<p>Dad and Uncle and i went out ate some noodles at some small
restaurant around the area. it was neat!. The atmosphere and vibe of
Taiwan was very different from what i was used to in Japan.</p>
<p>Then we went to visit some Relatives a short Train ride away. I then
sat among the Relatives in their Living room and the Relatives talked to
my Father and Uncle. i had no clue what they were talking about for 95%
of the time (i think they were speaking in some mixture of Taiwanese and
Mandarin; i know 0 Taiwanese and 1 Mandarin). I basically just stared
off into space except for a few times when one of them stopped to
interact with me for some reason or another. Once they asked me if i
wanted to leave to shop for Work Clothing(?) (dad was worried that i did
not have appropriate Clothing for my Future Potential Employment). Once
one of them showed me some travel guide about some Taiwan Night market
(in english) and gave me the WiFi password. But for the most part i just
sat there and did nothing , blending in with the couch.</p>
<p>We all then went to Dinner at an Restaurant. a Younger relative
around My Age showed up at the Restaurant and Ate with us. the Older
relatives kept trying to get That Younger Relative to practise their
English with me i think. Funnily enough i dont think a single time on
this trip i was asked to try to speak Mandarin.</p>
<p>In summary, this day i met some Relatives that i had never seen
before in my life. My tendancy to not Talk in general combined poorly
with the Language Barrier and i awkwardly talked minimally to the
Relatives.</p>
<h2 id="taiwan-day-2-taipei">taiwan day 2 – taipei</h2>
<p>In morning Uncle and Father (further abbreviated as UF) and i went
out walk around, bought food to eat as breakfast. i had unsweetened soy
milk and some Rice Ball Roll that i will eat as a leftover in
future.</p>
<p>Then we went to large Taiwan museum. the centerpiece of the entire
Museum was this Carving of Cabbage, and secondarily a Carving of Braised
Pork Belly. The museum gift shop contained mostly Souveniers involving
Cabbage. Also despite being called sth like “national palace museum”,
there was no Subway directly to the Museum, which was strange imo. UF
thought to take a Bus but then i think was too long to wait or sth so
took a taxi. However, took a bus back.</p>
<p>Eventually , Uncle and i went back to AIRBNB while father went to
purchase something somewhere. In the AIRBNB, Uncle said to me something
like “just a suggestion but when ur in a company u should project your
voice and say things when you want to say them because nobody
cares/nobody will ask if you have something to say”. to which i replied
“Ok thanks” or so, though i felt irritated and later at night writing in
notes theorizing how growing up with this kind of environment caused me
to hate talking or sth lol (my dad has said same type of things to me a
lot). A large part of this Taiwan trip was being slightly off-put by
things UF said/did.</p>
<p>At night UF and i went to some department store to buy ‘work
clothing’ i think. I think Dad just assumed i needed the clothing, and
idk what we would have done otherwise. So we went.</p>
<p>We went to a <ruby>無印良品<rt>muji</rt></ruby> and looked at some
clothes. I didn’t want to try on Pants (you had to interact with a
changing room person) so we didn’t get Pants. Nobody really felt
strongly about buying any Shirts so we didn’t get Shirts. But I wanted
to get a Towel so we got a Towel. We had a moment where dad looked at me
expecting to go pay and it was a Person checkout bro im not going to go
there idk any relevant language. so then we had a little Tussle where i
was ‘no bro its ok i know u want me to pay and its cringe that i dont
want to pay so we dont have to get the towel bro. ill put it back’ and
Dad was ‘fine bro ur cringe its ok ill get it’. or at least it seemed
like that.</p>
<p>We then went to a night market and walked around and went to some
place serving various Oyster dishes. we ate Oyster dishes. i saw someone
get a Beer and i suddenly wanted a Beer and asked dad Can I Get A Beer
and dad said umm no and then i said ok and kept eating and then dad
asked how is food and i said Good. It Would Taste Great With A Beer. and
dad said sth like can u drink bro. will u collapse. or so. and i said im
fine bro and so he requested a beer and gave it to me thanks dad!. This
was i think literally first time i had ingested Alcohol in front of any
of my Parents so it was a bit awkward, but the beer was an uninspiring
Lager taste. but did kind of go well with meal.</p>
<section id="aside-alcohol-is-cringe" class="aside">
<h3>aside: alcohol is cringe</h3>
<p>after dad got me this first beer it was kind of an awkward situation
because i think Dad is actually a Fan of Alcohol, while Mother is an
Anti of Alcohol. so Dad Likes alcohol but cannot Openly Like it without
being kind of Ashamed because Mother constantly says Bro Thats
Cringe.</p>
<p>However if u like something and then u find out that ur close
relative also likes it, would you not be sort of happy? Except you know
deep down that it is a Cringe thing that is Self-Destructive and that it
would be better to Not Like it.</p>
<p>This was what Dad seemed like when after i Ate that Beer. Sort of
like Enabling me Sure Bro Have Alcohol because I Like Alcohol And Its
All Chill Bro while also being aware that It is Bad for you and its
Cringe. It was also awkward that Uncle is sort of an Anti and
occasionally said ‘umm idk if u wanna Enable Drinking Alcohol bro’</p>
</section>
<h2 id="taiwan-day-3-taipei">taiwan day 3 – taipei</h2>
<p>followed UF around some sort of Electronics retailers and department
store. for lunch ate ‘western’ food , steak on pasta , pizza. for dinner
ate at a littleish restaurant decided on while walking around in
street.</p>
<p>do u remember what i just wrote about in the above Aside? This night
i went with Father to grocery store, and while it was probably mainly to
get Fruit, Dad allowed me put various Beer and some kind of Deer-Antler
Alcohol and some Snacks into the basket. Also they went over to the
Liquor counter because they wanted to check the price of some whiskey
that they said their friend wanted or sth and was cheaper in
Not-USA.</p>
<p>In the night i drank alcohol and ate snacks and clicked through TV
channels. Uncle sat next to me and tbh im surprised they didnt say
anything about me changing the channel about every 15 seconds. though
when i looked over at some point they seemed to be sleeping in a sitting
position.</p>
<section id="aside-alcohol-reviews" class="aside">
<h3>aside: alcohol reviews</h3>
<p>As for the alcohol i drank, i really don’t remember which i drank on
what day. I just remember that, across all Alcohol i drank across all
days in Taiwan,</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a ‘Taiwan’ wheatbeer that was pretty good, i like wheat
beers.</li>
<li>One ‘Taiwan draft’? lager was pretty good</li>
<li>the Deer Antler alcohol was .. interesting. apparently is related to
some kind of medicinal alcohols. it did taste along the lines of
medicine idk if i was supposed to be drinking it like a drink.</li>
</ul>
<p>i would like to repeat that alchol is cringe and the fact that i am
“reviewing” alcohol is cringe as well. if you drink alcohol and are
feeling offended “bro i drink alcohol am i cringe too??”, yes you are
cringe. self-destruction is not cool in any sense. idc whatever stupid
Romance has been built up around Alcohol; it is cringe.</p>
<p>actually i am building even more romance around Alcohol by writing
about it in my travels. that is kind of cringe ngl. i feel like my
father rn.</p>
</section>
<h2 id="taiwan-day-4-not-taipei">taiwan day 4 – not taipei</h2>
<p>today went with UF to Taizhong City as they went to meet some old
Neighbors. Neighbors came drove a Car picked us up and drove us to
Somewhere, idk where. they talked and then walked around places. Then we
all went to a Hotpot restaurant via Car. Some Neighbor’s Relatives (i
think) arrived. Two were slightly younger than me. They wanted the One
Closer to me in age (who was tutored in English?) to Socialize with me
and we Sort of did i guess. Also my dad told me “hey bro they have beer
over there” ok bro even though i have consumed ethanol on like 12 of the
last 13 days i am not about to Drink Alcohol in front of Two Young Folk
And Their Family That I Have Literally Just Met While Nobody Else Is
Doing The Same. though honestly it probably Would have been much more
comfortable to take Depressants than to Not. BUT life is not about what
is comfortable is it!??.🙂</p>
<p>Eventually we were driven back to Train station where took train to
<ruby>新竹<rt>hsinchu</rt></ruby>. Where we got off. and UF said hmm
well actually we tired and this train station is in the middle of kind
of nowhere theres no like connection the city or sth? so we just went
back to Taipei.</p>
<p>for dinner i ate leftover rice ball roll and a beer. i dont think dad
or uncle ate dinner..? maybe bc hotpot was all-you-can-eat and they ate
a lot.</p>
<h2 id="taiwan-day-5-taipei">taiwan day 5 – taipei</h2>
<p>today UF and i went to a family banquet, i.e. lots of relatives
gathered at some hotel eat expensive food. there were two other people
that looked to be somewhat around my age; one of them was the Relative
from Day 1 Dinner.</p>
<p>First, i stood around saying nothing. Then, i sat at the table saying
nothing. There was Wine and i drank the Wine happily to Depress my CNS.
I socialised a small bit with Day-1 Friend. We even went to the bathroom
together once after i asked them “bathroom” and they got up and asked
where the bathroom was. epic!.</p>
<p>After the banquet, Many of the relatives went to Apartment and talked
and stuff. About the whole day.</p>
<h2 id="taiwan-day-6-not-taipei">taiwan day 6 – not taipei</h2>
<p>today had a Bus tour booked. went on the Bus tour. One interesting
thing was: Dad had a sticker stuck to Shoe, and i didnt say anything
since i figured it would probably fall off soon or something (now that i
think abt it i think it would be better to just put it in a Trash
receptacle so idk why i didnt just say something. maybe i was just used
to not saying anything). But someone walking behind us said “hey bro u
have sticker on ur shoe” and dad said “oh thx bro lol blah blah blah
idk” and then they socialised or sth and then they had a Wife and Child
and kept bumping into during tour (bc we were on same tour) and said bye
bye when tour was over and stuff. Tbh that was maybe the most memorable
part of the Tour.</p>
<p>Another memorable Part was there was this Activity where you Write
Things on a Lantern and then Let It Float Away. i was maybe slightly
Anticipating this because i was enthusiastic about Calligraphy. however
my writing was terrible and i became disillusioned and also didnt know
what else to write. so i wrote ‘<ruby>我要回家<rt>i want to go
home</rt></ruby>’ as real silly, a real hehe joke or sth (or maybe just
bc it was like the only other phrase i remembered how to write) and dad
said “bro what, lol” and i realised i was Cringe and said “lol” and then
lined it out, to which my dad said “bro wtf dont do that” and i
assumed/interpreted i had just commited a grave Cultural No-No so that
was awkward and thus memorable.</p>
<p>The other parts of the Tour was ok, we saw some rocks, and a
waterfall, and sat in bus a lot where i mostly drifted in and out of
sleep bc most of Taiwan trip i kept waking up Early to UF noises cant go
back to sleep.</p>
<p>Lunch we had some little Snacks, little Bites on the Tour and that
was basically it iirc. Dinner we went to eat Dinner with a Relative that
Dad had forgotten to give some Stuff to. Probably most memorable part of
Dinner was that they ordered Bamboo Shoot that came served with
Mayonnaise, and then UF started talking about Oh Bro youve never had
this before right. And um no i dont think i had haved bamboo shoot
cooked like that i think? though i have had bamboo shoot before? so idrk
i didnt really say much, and then UF start explaining what Mayonnaise is
as if it was some exotic Sauce or sth (ig it is if you look at it close
enough).</p>
<section id="aside-the-urge-to-explain-and-to-know" class="aside">
<h3>aside: the urge to Explain and to Know</h3>
<p>my Dad and often Uncle loved to Explain things to me. This is nice
sometimes, I guess. But they <em>really</em> liked explaining things,
and they didn’t really care to check if I already knew the things they
were explaining. Here is an example conversation that i recorded in my
notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> do u know what taizhong<sup>(台中)</sup>
means</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Taiwan middle?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> middle of taiwan because its the middle of
taiwan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>here is sort of another example</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>older relative to me:</strong> (something in mandarin
greeting me goodbye);
<ruby>再<rt>zai</rt></ruby><ruby>回<rt>hui</rt></ruby>a</p>
<p><strong>me:</strong> (hmm did they say ‘再回a’? does that mean ‘come
back again’? what else did they say? hmm? how do i greet them goodbye?
do i nod? wave? wave. nod. idk)</p>
<p><strong>dad or uncle (translating for me):</strong> come again</p>
<p><strong>me:</strong> (oh ok so it Did must have been 再回a which
meant come again.)</p>
<p><strong>dad or uncle:</strong> What did you think they said?
Guess.</p>
<p><strong>me:</strong> (??? bro you just said the translation? what do
you expect me to say?? if i say “come again” are you going to question
me saying “bro did u just say that because i literally translated it for
you?”)</p>
<p><strong>me:</strong> idk</p>
<p><strong>uncle:</strong> maybe you should start learning chinese</p>
</blockquote>
<p>anyways being with my Uncle and Father often just felt like being a
Sixth Grader among Sixth Graders competing who Knew the Most. like when
we were riding trains sometimes Dad would wonder “hmm where do we need
to go?” and than uncle would say “Its probably this” and then dad would
be like “hmm idk” and then we walk for a bit and then uncle would see
some sign that proved that they were right and they would just Point to
it and triumphantly pose like “haha see bro i was right lol”.</p>
<p>Also one time we were walking through Electronics Shop and i pointed
to some Anker (electronics brand) display and asked Dad if Anker was a
Taiwanese company, and he responded Yes. and then shortly after i asked
if Logitech was also a Taiwan brand. and then he responded with sth like
“yeah bro all these brands are Taiwanese, most of them started by my
Classmates<sup>(father went to some technology university in
Taiwan)</sup> xd. we here to buy Electronics bc its cheaper to buy
Taiwanese electronics in Taiwan”. Later randomly i decided to look up
and confirm that they were actually Taiwanese companies; Anker is a
(mainland) Chinese company and Logitech is a Swiss company, lmao.</p>
<p>end of rant haha :)</p>
</section>
<h2 id="taiwan-day-7-taipei">taiwan day 7 – taipei</h2>
<p>this day i woke up at 6am when dad and uncle was leaving to catch
their flight back to usa. iirc i felt tired or sth but couldnt go back
to sleep again. i packed my backpack , cleaned up , and ate some
<ruby>convenience<rt>store</rt></ruby> food that i got father to
purchase me yesterday thx dad:).</p>

<li>5 pairs of T-Shirts and Underpants</li>
<li>Epinephrine injector</li>
<li>Gacha capsule containing little souvenier I planned to give to

<li>Charging cable in nifty charging-cable retainer i bought in Japan

<li>(Not in picture) plastic teeth retainer</li>
<li>(Not in picture) toothbrush and little toothpaste in plastic

</ul>
<p>This is about the same haul I brought to Japan, except I no longer
had Laptop or Handkerchief (i gave them to dad to carry home. thanks
dad!), my charging cables were in neat Retainer box things, and I now
had an Umbrella and Coin purse.</p>
<p>Looking back, i never used the SSD or
Picture-of-duck-with-vaccination-card and would not bring on another
trip if i go on one. I would also maybe only bring One mask just in Very
case; could always just More if needed at convenience store. In my
entire travels I only used a mask Once, and that situation was avoidable
(going into library in Japan which had a sign saying to put on
mask).</p>
<p>After eating and packing i took a little nap i think until it was
time to check out of the AIRBNB. i checked out of the AIRBNB and then
went to wander around Taipei City. i knew approximately Zero about
Taiwan unfortunately. so i looked up “japantown” i dont think i found
anything. i looked up “koreatown” and found some Street that was
supposed to be some kind of korea someting. so i took train there, and
tbh the most Korean thing i remember seeing was a poster advertising
Tourism to the city of <ruby>대구<rt>daygoo</rt></ruby>.</p>

<p>I probably then walked to nearby subway station and rode to Taipei
station, where i ate McDonalds. i thought it was Kisok order but then i
had to print receipt and then hand to a worker to pay which was slightly
anxiety inducing. they said sth i didnt understand but i paid and got my
receipt and waited for my order and picked up my order and ate it
outside the station which did not feel like the cleanest and best
smelling environment but i was hungry didnt really care. i had</p>

<p>it was nice. then i took train to airport bc i didnt really feel like
doing anything else. but i arrived too early it was 5:40pm or so and
they didnt let people check in until 7:25pm. So i just sat around the
airport charging phone and so, occasionally going outside and sitting in
the smoking area because that was the only comfortable place to sit
outside (i went outside bc i was cold inside).</p>
<p>eventually , i checked in . went through airport security . waited at
my gate. to board the plane i had to get on a Bus and then the Bus drove
to the Plane and everyone got off the Bus and walked up Steps to the
Plane which was interesting, i dont think ive ever had that kind of
boarding.</p>
