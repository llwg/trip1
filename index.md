# trip to east-asia

hello, here is documentation about a trip i took to east-asia in 2023. my trip was approx 2023/8/26-2023/9/23 and i wrote this documentation during approx 2023/10/4-2023/10/15, with each day of my trip taking about half a day to document. The exception to this is Taiwan; I documented my entire Taiwan trip in like 3/4ths of a day because idk.

I was going to write some conclusions or reflections about the trip in general but tbh i dont want to. ten days in a country really isn't very much if u think about it (or even if u dont think about it) and i dont feel comfortable making judgements about an entire country as if they are remotely insightful or useful or anything.

my Writing Style for this documentation is kind of a mess and in general the writing and the contents is kind of Cringe and like 30% just records of Me Feeling Uncomfortable In Social Situations. It is rambly and has no particular Story or Cohesive Theme and is not particularly Pleasant to Read; in fact I literally have not read what i have written besides the most skim of skimmings because i simply Do Not Want To Read It.

however it is done, and maybe i can come back to it one day and think , "haha, how funny and cringe and awesome. what fun young days." beyond this i am not sure if it has any other Value, except for a few nice Pictures sprinkled in somewhere idk where.

Have Fun and Read As You Please and feel free to Contact Me about any Curiosities. good bye!

note: some web-pages here are sort of gigantic and may load up to like 0.6gb of pictures/media at once
