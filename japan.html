<p>first thing i did was figure out immigration and customs (the two
things u have to do to exit airport). i think u could write fill out a
form. but i also saw some youtube video or sth before that you can fill
out online and gives u qr code or sth and can just scan and is maybe
marginally faster or more convenient. so i did that. the most difficult
thing was writing where i was going to stay, partially because i have no
clue how japanese addresses work, and also idk where i was going to
stay. so i looked up some random hotel that i potentially could maybe
stay and put that down. and it worked and i went thru the immigration
and customs without much problem. though when i was going through
customs the guy handling stuff or something looked at my stuff and said
<ruby>これだけ<rt>just this</rt></ruby>? and i responded in english
something like “yeah” and then they asked in english again “just this?”
i think and i responded sth like “yes just this” and they kind of like
poked around in my reusable grocery bag of stuff while i awkwardly
fumbled around with the customs QR code digital machine something.</p>
<p>anyways i finally passed all the stuff and ended up in The Airport
where tbh i didnt really know what to do. i thought about should i get
some kind of sim card type of deal so i can have mobile data around
japan? i saw some kind of counter areas that sold them probably , but i
didnt want to interact with the people it was scary. so i just sat
around looking stuff up on my phone on the very unreliable airport wifi
. i bought an USD 8 dollar esim data thing . and then discovered my
phone doesnt use ESIM, which was unfortunate. <small>but at least i
saved USD 8.5 by not taking JFK airtrain so it evens out (::</small></p>
<p>I Withdrew Japan JPY money from airport ATM , by using credit card.
how it works is i had to set up credit card ‘cash withdrawal’ or sth
pin, then i use machine, and it worked. Looking at my credit card
statement, it didnt show any fees, so i expected that there wasnt any
fees.</p>
<section id="aside-i-was-wrong" class="aside">
<h3>aside: i was wrong</h3>
<p>there were fees for withdraw cash with my credit card. it just didnt
CHARGE ME THE FEE UNTIL IT ACTUALLY APPROVED/THE CHARGE FULLY “WENT
THROUGH”, which took something like three or four days?? THANKS LOL.</p>
<p>i wonder if i could use debit/atm card. but mine is expired and my
bank doesnt plan on giving me a new one so idk.</p>
</section>
<p>idrk what else i did i probably used the bathroom and told my parents
my plane didnt explode. i also came across the famous legendary Japan
Vending Machine.</p>

<p>Eventually i decided to Leave The Airport. To do this i looked for
signs that indicated some kind of train. i also looked up and seem u
gotta take “Keikyu line” out the airport because the “main” network
doesnt connect(?) to tokyo haneda airport ?</p>
<section id="aside-japan-train-companies-and-lines" class="aside">
<h3>aside: japan train companies and lines</h3>
<p>one thing i discovered shortly before or after arriving in japan is
that there are a lot of different companies running train lines. like if
u look at a map of the tokyo area trains, there are the Japan Railways
(JR) lines <sup>(which i interpret to be the biggest company because idk
thats just what it feels like. also it has Japan in its name)</sup>, but
there are also a gazillion other different companies lines going
everywhere. and if ur at a train station theres often signs for “JR
lines” versus like <ruby>大江戸線<rt>another line thing run by different
company</rt></ruby> or um the aforementioned
<ruby>keikyu<rt>京急</rt></ruby> line (also run by diff company), and
many others that idk bc ive never taken them.</p>
<p>in practicality I don’t think there is much difference between most
and they look and feel basically the same , buy tickets same , i think u
can use same IC/transportation card the same<sup>(idk because i never
bought an IC card)</sup>. but they are in separate areas of large
station n stuff and are just . different i guess.</p>
</section>
<section id="another-aside-japan-train-paying" class="aside">
<h3>another aside: japan train, paying</h3>
<p>how do u pay get on train in japan??. in this section i talk about
how u can pay to ride most train in japan on major lines probably.</p>
<h4 id="ic-card">IC card</h4>
<p>japan, like many other areas that i have seen of the world, has a
thing called “IC card”, which is little card that u can press to things
and it goes BEEP and and it pays for things and stuff. to my
understanding u BEEP it when u go thru entrance gate, BEEP it when u
leave exit gate, it automatically charge u based on distance travelled.
i personally have never used this in japan , i think i saw they were
having a shortage of them or something. and tbh paying with cash and
using physical tickets is so very convenient in japan i never really
found the need to be more convenient. though i wonder if there is
discount for using IC card bc ik in south korea there was a discount OH
WELL</p>
<h4 id="physical-ticket">physical ticket</h4>
<p>at each station hopefully there is a digital ticket machine. u press
“ticket” or something and then press one of many set numeric values. and
then it asks u for MONEY , in my experience these machines only accept
cash . u give it the money, it gives u the ticket worth the NUMERIC
VALUE THAT U PRESSED (and your change). then to enter the gate, u put it
in the thing. it punches ur ticket and gives it back to u and lets u
thru. and when u exit u put it into the thing and if your ticket amount
is appropriate (greater or equal) it eats ur ticket and lets u thru, and
if it is too little money worth, it says NO BRO and u cant go thru and
it gives u back ur ticket. and usually i think there is a ticket inside
the gates where u can insert ur ticket and pay the difference and u can
go thru or something (FARE ADJUSTMENT MACHINE)? but the one single time
i tried to use this it did not work. and i had to go talk to someone
very awkwardly and i said sth like “fare adjustment” and then they did
some calculations and then showed my calculator with money i need to pay
and i gave it to them and left.</p>
<p>note: FARE ADJUSTMENT MACHINE does not give u a refund if you have a
ticket worth more than u actually need to pay. i tried this.</p>
<p>How do you know HOW MUCH VALUE TICKET U NEED??, at your departing
station they will have a map of the nearby area with numeric values at
each nearby station telling u HOW MUCH U NEED TO PAY IN TICKET VALUE.
here is an example</p>

<h4 id="other">OTHER</h4>
<p>once i went to small ish city town area , and i think the train
station only had a little like cute ticket vending machine that only
took cash or sth , and there were no automatic gates just people that
checked ur ticket that was wild . though unfortunately i didnt ride it
bc i didnt want to interact with ticket checking person.</p>
</section>
<section id="aside-japan-cash-paying-machines" class="aside">
<h4>aside: japan cash paying machines</h4>
<p>it is relatively easy to pay with cash in Japan compared to the
Handful of Developed Countries That I Have Visited. In many situations
(e.g. Seven Eleven, Train Ticket Machines, Probably More) that you Find
Yourself Paying with Cash, often there is a Machine that you Insert your
Cash in Yourself, instead of handing the Cash to a human. These Machines
often have Neat Features, including you can Place A Stack Of Bills in
the slot and it will eat them all in one go (instead of insert one at a
time), and also there is large funnel u can throw all ur coins in at
once (instead of insert one at a time). Coming from USA Where I Never
saw this kind of device, it Surprised me and Delighted me. Let Me Know

<p><span class="drop-caps">anyways i went took the</span> train. it was
my first time on a japan train tbh i had no clue what i was doing i
stood there in the train looking at the map wondering where exactly i
was going. at the airport the fare listed to get to
<ruby>SHINAGAWA<rt>品川</rt></ruby> station was uhh idk like 400 yen or
sth? i actually dont remember. but i bought that amount ticket and
boarded a train that seemed to be going towards
<ruby>SHINAGAWA<rt>品川</rt></ruby>. at one point i think it stopped and
i wondered hmm whys it stopped. was it the final stop? so i just got off
bc it seemed like it was gonna go back the other way. i think it did.
though some ppl i think just kept sitting on the train, i am not sure
why they kept sitting since it was going back where it came from. or
maybe i just am hallucinating.</p>

<p><span class="drop-caps">the first p</span>icture i took of shinjuku
was trash in front of vending machines. in My Youth i occasionally
encountered Online Communities Very Keen As Japan As A Concept. I
Remember One online post which some kind of Praise Japan as Very Clean,
So much so that When Waste Disposal Receptacle is full, the Japanese
Person will Place the Waste Around The Waste Disposal Receptacle.
finally, i witness this “behavior” in my Own Eyes, though Tbh ive
literally seen the same thing in e.g. new york city but new york city
still smells like urine and trash and weed. Any ways, I walked around
shinjuku station . here were some first impressions i remember
having</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a Wendy’s (i know Wendy’s from USA)</li>
<li>there are small Streets with lots of stores and signs or something
and stuff</li>
<li>there are large Roads that are very Big with Cars</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, There were both Small Streets but also Large Roads. The Large
Roads apparently left a greater impression on me, as i took pictures of
them (i did not the small streets).</p>

<p>tbh it felt kind of empty and i think i was experience some kind of
light disillusionment. i think i watched too many urbanist youtube
videos and assumed that any non-U.S. city would be some kind of paradise
where everyone is frolicing in car-free streets and rainbows and stuff.
but , this was not the case. it was noticeably clean and smelled
good<sup>(not bad)</sup> , at least after spending the last month(s) in
new york city.</p>
<section id="thoughts-about-city-layout" class="aside">
<h3>THOUGHTS ABOUT city layout</h3>
<p>i was raised in very Rural area for basically my whole life and the
only city ive really been to for an extended period of time is New York
City (NYC). especially in NYC manhattan , it feels very . . uniform and
grid-y. everything is in a GRID and u have large areas that are simply
1st street, 2nd street, 3rd street, blah blah blah , and u can identify
the general area of a spot by saying e.g. “40th street and 6th avenue”
like ur plotting a point on a coordinate plane. Also every street looks
about the same . is about the same width with same-looking sidewalks .
and the only thing that distinguishes them is what is along them.</p>
<p>i think , most areas of japan i went to were not griddy. they kinda
went up and down and diagonal and idk . i still dont know how japans
addressing system works . i don’t think I looked at street names for 90%
of my navigations i just looked at gps and guessed , followed signs,
etc. Also, esp in cities, Japan streets varied a lot. there were large
Roads and then small streets coming off of them, and then some streets
that were noticeably intended for Pedestrians, and stuff. the Density of
Stuff seemed more Uneven, and that made sense. but it was unfamiliar to
me As Someone Grew Up In Rural Suburban USA. Leave A Comment Down Below

<p>I continued to walk around Shinjuku Station. I decided to try to go
into a “Bic Camera” store, because i read something online say they sell
SIM cards. So i went up entered a large Bic Camera store, and there were
people employees standing around looking like they want to help you they
gonna talk to u looked like. So i simply left and walked away, and
decided to go to a park.</p>
<p>i walked to the park. the scenery along the way was uninspiring . big
roads. tall buildings. not many people. i saw some homeless people
encampment underneath some bridges, they had signs put up that included
English that said to not take pictures/videos of them . i saw some
pigeons.</p>
<p>i arrived the park. it was ok, it looked like a city park. there was
free wifi so i sat down and used phone for a while probably.</p>

<h3>mine internet connectivity</h3>
<p>i did not buy a sim card in japan and thus had no mobile data. thus i
couldnt really look stuff up while walking .</p>
<p>i did download offline google maps . which occasionally came in handy
to look up a location probably ?. probably</p>
<p>GPS worked without data . but it was a bit wonky like it was off by a
few meters usually and took a long time to update position.</p>
<p>when i needed internet, there was occasionally internet in places
like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>train stations . were usually most “reliable” (which still wasnt
very reliable)</li>
<li>in some urban areas, e.g. shinjuku , there is just random public
wifi out around. usually very spotty and randomly cant connect.</li>
<li>convenience stores sometimes have some form of wifi at them. often
do not though , in my experience. also questionable reliability.</li>
<li>random stores, department stores occasionally have free wifi. these
are usually fairly reliable. sometimes.</li>
<li>the place where you are staying for the night. usually reliable
internet. very good!</li>
</ol>
<p>in summary my internet connectivity was a bit painful except for
number 5. the end.</p>
</section>
<p>Eventually came Lunch Time, and it was time for me to Eat Lunch.</p>
<p>i looked up a convenience store. i selected a Lunch Box from there
cost JPY 498. i hand Stuff to cashier. they ask me if i want my Lunch
Box heated up (in japanese). I reply with affirmative body language and
“yes please” (in english). they then reply i think
<ruby>バック<rt>bag</rt></ruby>? (in english). And i reply with negative
body language, probably sth like shaking head/hand n stuff. they give me
my Now-Heated Lunch Box, and I Leave The Store; They Give Me The Typical
Farewell Greeting And I Probably Try To Reciprocate It With Light Body
Language probably While Leaving. And so ends my Silly adventure at the
Convenience store.</p>
<section id="social-anxiety" class="aside">
<h3>social anxiety</h3>
<p>I think I have social anxiety. I often do not want to speak; I do not

<p>I have this problem, perhaps more, in foreign languages. I think I
may be afraid of saying something silly or sounding silly or idk. I was
am deathly afraid of speaking foreign languages, especially when it is
not “strictly necessary”.</p>

<p>I watched lots of Japanese Animation in middle-high school

<p>That Being Said , i have outputted Japanese approximately Zero or One
or Two times in my life, and i predict my output skill is basically
Zero, or at least my confidence in it is Zero. i think i said , in total

<p>my order was: - Roasted Soy Sauce Double Thick Beef - McFry (L) -
Sokenbicha (L)</p>
<p>it was cool, yummy. the Sokenbicha is some kind of tea,
refreshing.</p>
<p><span class="drop-caps">i then went to</span> a convenience store and
bought a toothbrush and toothpaste and case little set thing, and a
bottle of water.</p>
<p>then, it was time to Go Somewhere To Sleep. i dont actually remember
but i assume i was tired from time difference and walking around and
stuff. after some consideration throughout the day and research
probably, i decided to go to <ruby>まんが喫茶マンボー新宿南口<rt>MANGA
CAFE MANBOO, SHINJUKU SOUTH EXIT</rt></ruby>.</p>
<p>i arrive at the building. entrance is at upper floor. i walk up the
building and experience anxiety at the door. then press the door and
walk in. and then um i think , i like stood there awkwardly , and then ,
probably approached counter , and then honestly i dont remember , maybe
because i dont want to remember. i think i remember pointing at
something on the price sheet. and i also remember the employee pulled
out this cool cute little translator thing where u can talk into it and
it translates it and then u can show it to ur opponent. i experienced
some confusion i think once the translaty thing said sth about the top
floor being empty or sth ? but i think it had to do with vacant and
empty being same concepts and me forgetting that bc in english i think
they are more separate.</p>
<p>anyways after somewhat dying i somewhat survived and they gave me ,
not a key , but a receipt. assigned me a room. actually not a room it
was cubicle style . i went to the cube.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">8.27 19:26 GMT+9: my cube (picture taken
after i got usb, as discussed below)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>the cube was not locked . but there was a combination safe for safe
keeping things if desired. i got the um . flat room, which is the
‘floor’ is raised and has these pleather firm cushioning so u can sit or
lie down on. came with two pleather cushions !.</p>
<p>the price ended up being um i think JPY 4000 for 15 hours. which is
actually i think one of most expensive lodgings i stayed in. i simply
must check out at 15 hours after my check in and i am good . if not they
charge more .</p>
<p>i wished to shower. on an information sheet on the cube wall i
believe it said to bring ur receipt to front desk . so i brought my
receipt to front desk . and said the single word
<ruby>シャワー<rt>shower</rt></ruby> but really slowly and traily offy
and hesitant so it wasnt as obvious i didnt know any other word than
<ruby>シャワー<rt>shower</rt></ruby>. and then the same person that had
communicated with me with the cute little translation device thing gave
me a briefing on the shower in fully japanese and i nodded and gave
affirmative body language and took the shower key they gave me , and
went to shower and showered . oh also I Think they asked me if i needed
a towel which would cost money and i replied negatively (I Think). the
shower was nice!</p>

<section id="japanese-bath-and-shower" class="aside">
<h3>japanese bath and shower</h3>
<p>among all the countries i have Been To In My Life, japanese showers
and baths have been the most Positive experience. i like the design
where the shower is an entire little Room with a folding door. u can
shower as u please spray water up down anywhere without worrying ur
gonna mess something up. i like the Drains where the drain is not
actually just a Hole , but removable flooring that covers an area that
goes into a Hole. i have not shown any Baths yet but baths are nice ,
good practical balance of Height and width.</p>
</section>
<p>after shower i probably sat in my room idk doing what. i decided i
wanted to use the cube’s computer. but, the screen says something like
please insert usb to unlock computer or sth. and when i boot up computer
it goes into a default user, then some software starts up and it
displays please insert usb to unlock. so i figured perhaps some kind of
security system u need a usb to unlock. so i typed up a message saying
sth like “i want to use computer but it says blah blah blah do i need
some kind of usb?” and reverse translated it to make sure it made sense,
then went to front desk and showed them my message . and person read it
and ummm i dont really remember what they said but i remember i went and
got my passport and gave it to them and then i think they filled out
some kind of membership registration form , they asked me to write my
name on the form i think and then they did some stuff idk i remember
just standing there in front lobby right next to the bookshelf of
gravure magazines wondering what i was doing , in life , in general ,
but eventually they gave me my very own manboo membership card :) and a
usb , which i took back to room , and plugged into computer , and it
worked.</p>
<p>The computer was interesting , it had 4gb of ram which tbh doesnt
sound like too little but even basic web browsing it frequently
out-of-memoried , froze up. also the manboo portal home site thing had
three large central buttons that u might be able to see in picture of
Cube above: Manga lookup, Videos, and Adult Videos. all the essentials
of life !.</p>
<p>Soon i was ready to go to sleep. it was very cold . information says
that u can borrow blankets free at an station, but i went the station
and couldnt see any. unfortunate!. i was cold. i thought about going to
front and asking but i was done , i had had Enough interaction. but i
think it was on my way back from trying and successfully using the Free
Drink Machine at the front which dispenses a little paper cup and drink
inside it, i passed by the station again and noticed that the towels
were at the station . i had simply not seen them bc it was dark. so i
got two blankets (they werent that big). and then i go to sleep. oh also
i brushed teeth before sleeping in the bathroom.</p>
<p>even with two blankets the aircondition was literally blowing onto me
so i was still a bit chilly. also even though i was staying on the
nonsmoking floor , the entire place smelled vaguely of smoke. and my
towel that was drying on a hanger smelled like cigarettes in the
morning. END OF DAY 1</p>

<p>i probably wanted to go back to sleep ? but i did not iirc. after
using bathroom sink i used the Free Drink machine to get a cup of hot
tea, and accidentally a cup of cold tea with crushed ice in it. and then
i sat in my Cube . after sitting in my Cube for a while i packed up all
my stuff back into my trusty reusable grocery bag and left the Lodging

<p>when i went to the front counter to check out , i believe the person

<p>I wanted to go to restaurant called Denny’s , because I have seen
that ‘family restaurants’ are cool and epic in Japan. and also because
there is Denny’s in USA so it would be cool to go to Denny’s in Japan.
So, i walked to a Denny’s.</p>
<p>When i arrived at Denny’s i gained Anxiety and did not want to go
into Denny’s. So i continued walking North and West within Shinjuku,
because in that direction i read was some kind of Korea-Town area, which
sounded Interesting.</p>
<p>On the way i bought three Rice Balls and a bottle of Tea at a
seven-eleven. and then i kept walking West and North intending to sit
down somewhere when i found a spot to sit down and Eat them.</p>
<p>Eventually i reached some kind of area that looked like a Korea-Town
because there was Korean Writing on signs and stuff. however i did not
find a place to sit ; i went to some kind of park thing but it was
closed , so i simply ate some rice ball standing in street. I continued
to walk around and sometimes eat rice ball and drink tea , and i think i
also got some fruits drink from a vending machine and drank that,
yum!.</p>

<p>after wandering around doing nothing in particular , i decided to try
to go to a library to use wifi. i am not sure why i wanted to use wifi,
but i did . so i looked up a library on offline google maps , and i went
there. there was no wifi . but i looked around the library for a few
mins , and left. i then went to this lunch box place that i passed by
earlier and looked cool . i simply went in , and then chose an lunch
box. and also a grape fanta bc the lunch box seemed too cheap and i felt
like i was ripping them off by just buying a single lunch box . i payed
for my things by going to the counter and then giving the person the
money and stuff and then leaving.</p>
<p>I went to a park that i had wandered by and briefly sat in earlier
and ate my food. the food was nice. the grape fanta was sweet and
carbonated and tbh i think gave me a tummy ache .</p>

<p>Then i walked to a train station and Left shinjuku, went to

locations that i knew the existence of beforehand in tokyo .</p>

counterclockwise.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span class="drop-caps">i decided t</span>o first go to a lodging ,
drop things off , and then walk around the area. Because it was tiring
carry my grocery bag. so i decided on an
<ruby>MANBOO<rt>マンボー</rt></ruby> location closeish to akihabara
station which had a coin shower according to their website. i wanted
Coin Shower because that means i can take shower without talking to the
Front desk.</p>
<p>So i went there and i dont exactly remember how i got a room. i think
I typed up an message on my Cell phone and showed it to them asking if
they got any rooms?. and then they asked some things about what room i
want , they was out of standard rooms ? they said , so i got deluxe room
. Deluxe room was very nice , it was wide. And it had its own
aircondition. also i think this manboo all their rooms were actual Rooms
, not cubicle. you could Lock the door. i payed 3200 yen for the Room ,
check-in any time between 11am and midnight , check out by 11am next
day. notbad imo.</p>

</figure>
<p>I took a Look at the facilities , and then i prepared to go to on a
<ruby>外出<rt>GAISYUTU</rt></ruby> (T/N: GAISYUTU means GO OUT). this
was challenging because to go on a <ruby>外出<rt>GAISYUTU</rt></ruby> ,
you have to present ur receipt/keys to the FRONT, and then they take ur
RECEIPT/keys and give u a little card and then u leave and when u come
back u give them back ur little card and they give u back ur
receipt/keys. the tricky part of this is that u have to GO TO THE FRONT
and talk to the person. however, i did it , i think i might have even
said <ruby>外出<rt>がいしゅつ</rt></ruby> to the person real slowly in a
manner similar to how i once said <ruby>シャワー<rt>shower</rt></ruby> ,
and they gave me the little card and i left.</p>
<section id="aside-plot-holes" class="aside">
<h3>aside: plot holes</h3>
<p>i mentioned before how <ruby>シャワー<rt>shower</rt></ruby> was the
only japanese words i spoke on this trip. however after digging deeper
into my memories i think this may not be true. for example, i may have
said <ruby>外出<rt>GAISYUTU</rt></ruby> as described above. and thinking
more , i may have even said <ruby>終了<rt>SYUURYOU</rt></ruby> in the
future when indicating my will to check out . perhaps i even said more
things in the future. i do not know.</p>
</section>
<p>I went up back around Akihabara station , and i went to i think a
<ruby>DAISO<rt>like japanese dollar store</rt></ruby> inside a
<ruby>YODOBASHI CAMERA<rt>giant store thing</rt></ruby>. on the way up
to DAISO i browsed the YODOBASHI CAMERA which was a real sensory
experience , i also ended up buying some kind of
<ruby>Shouchuu<rt>焼酎</rt></ruby> alcohol at the alcohol section (idk
why theres an alcohol section).</p>
<section id="aside-purchasing-alcohol-in-japan" class="aside">
<h3>aside: purchasing alcohol in japan</h3>
<p>in USA when u purchase alcohol , often you must present ur ID to a
fellow human to verify that u are above the legal drinking age. some
cashier check ur id, some will not.</p>
<p>in Japan i did not present my ID once in all my several times
purchasing alcohol. maybe its bc i already looked old or sth idk. At
convenience store , there is often a little display on the kiosk asking
if ur above the drinking age and u have to press it , but this was the
most verification i underwent in my travels. at this YODOBASHI CAMERA
alcohol section the person did not do any kind of verification.</p>

<section id="aside-the-money-tray" class="aside">
<h3>aside: THE MONEY TRAY</h3>
<p>in many, most? japanese (and i think other later countries probably)
Establishments i have purchased things and Exchanged Money at , there is
a little Tray where i have learned you should put ur Money and Payment
and things. i learned that this is the function when i visited this
YODOBASHI CAMERA alcohol section and payed by first putting a bill on
the counter , and the cashier put it in THE TRAY which i only then
noticed.</p>
</section>
<p>and then i went to the DAISO and purchased Pocket-monster dining
table cleaning wipes, and a coin purse pouch wallet.</p>

<p>and then i went to a fast-food place called Matsuya which was
suggested by an friend who heard about it or sth . when i went to it i
also realised i had passed by several earlier in the day and wondered
what it was. I ordered a Packaged Takeaway food; my order was:</p>
<ul>
<li><ruby>牛焼肉定食 特盛/プレーン<rt>cow grilled meat set</rt></ruby>
(JPY 690)</li>
<li><ruby>焼肉小鉢のりキム<rt>little side dish thing of seaweed and
kimchi</rt></ruby> (JPY 90)</li>
</ul>
<p>and also i stopped by convenience store on way back to Lodging to buy
an beer.</p>

<p>I got back to the lodging and took a shower in the Coin Shower , and
then it was time to eat!!. I forgot to get utensils at the Matsuya. And
i didnt want to ask the Front even though i knew they probably had them.
So i folded up one of the plastic lids and used it as a spoon kind of to
eat my Food.</p>

<p>The food was good . The rice was big (i ordered it big) and nice.
except the salad which i had no dressing for and just ate plain raw
vegetables. The Shouchuu i poured into my empty salad bowl to drink. it
tasted sort of like something between whiskey and wine. The beer tasted
uninspiring very generic beer i think.</p>
<p>I don’t really remember what I did for the rest of the night but I
assume just brush teeth and go to sleep. END OF DAY 2</p>

<p>in the morning i believe i looked things up on the internet. I looked
up a “100-yen locker” where i could store my belongings so i didnt have
to carry them around while i walk around. And I ended up booking a whole
Hotel , but a “capsule hotel” , in shinjuku. because it was cheap and
said it had a bath.</p>

<h3>N-yen lockers</h3>
<p>in urban japan i see many temporary lockers that u can put things in
, pay , lock, come back to , and unlock, and take stuff. Around train
stations and stuff and just on streets.</p>
<p>There are many types of these , vary in Pricing per time, size, what
u use to unlock<sup>is there physical key u take? can u unlock and pay
using IC card?</sup>, etc.</p>
<p>the one i used was 100 yen for i think..8 hrs?? though i spent 200
yen bc i didnt know u can only unlock it once. you put Coin in it and
then u can lock it with the physical Key and the Key comes out and u
carry it around and then come back and put the Key back in and unlock
it.</p>
</section>
<p>Then i walk a bit around <ruby>Kanda<rt>神田</rt></ruby> area. I
walked into a ‘hanamaru udon’ shop because i knew the name but didnt
know it was an udon chain shop fast food type thing. however it looked
like u had to interact heavily with people to get food and i was scared
and i simply turned around on the stairs down and left.</p>
<p>i walk up to Akihabara area, and back to Matsuya , where i ordered
food to eat in the store. i ordered
<ruby>ネギたま牛めしランチ大盛<rt>green-onion and egg beef rice lunch
large portion</rt></ruby>. it was very tasty. and sit down eat in
matsuya u get free miso soup and pickled radish and salad dressing.
delicious!.</p>

<p>I then walked around Akihabara. It was nice , there were many Things
to look at. As you may not know, akihabara is maybe known for having
many Hobby things , and there were indeed many Hobby things , and in
general just many small Interesting things to examine. There were many
large tall buildings that contain many Shops selling many different
Things, and there were Arcades, and there were things. i walked around.
and i walked through some streets. it was neat. Also i bought a Bag from
the store <ruby>無印良品<rt>muji</rt></ruby> to hopefully carry things
around slightly more comfortablyer than my reusable grocery bag.</p>

<p>After walking around Akihabara , i took the train one stop back to
<ruby>神田駅<rt>KANDA STATION</rt></ruby>, reasoning that since i used a
100-yen locker instead of a more common 300-yen locker , the
less-than-200-yen train ticket was covered by the cheapness of the
100-yen locker. I retreived my belongings and then went back to shinjuku
, in fact the exact 新大久保駅 that i entered to go to akihabara on day
2, and went to the “capsule hotel” i booked in the morning.</p>

<h3>aside: capsule hotel</h3>
<p>An ‘Capsule Hotel’ is a Lodging where ur Bed is a little capsule
stacked among other Capsules (other peoples beds). and the bathroom is
probably public.</p>
</section>
<p>this was first ‘hotel’ i stay at. The check in process was new for
me. i think i tried to say sth in Japanese like
“<ruby>reservation<rt>予約?</rt></ruby>” But the employee could tell i
had no clue what i was doing and directed me in english to hand over
passport and fill out something on a form and put shoes in locker and
things.</p>
<p>i looked around and put my stuff in my provided locker. then i went
out. i wasnt sure if i was supposed to leave my key at front or
something but i didnt and didnt experience any problems.</p>
<p>I decide to go to <ruby>Shibuya<rt>渋谷</rt></ruby> , one of the
places i heard of before coming to Tokyo. I took the train, and got off
train. There i crossed a large Scramble Crossing which i assumed was
Famous Japanese Scramble Crossing i had heard of before , because it was
big, but also because there were tourists taking pictures. After
checking map i think It Was.</p>

<p>it was getting late and i had not eaten dinner , so i looked around
for a place to eat. However, all of the places to eat looked terrifying
because u had to interact with people. Even stores where you get a
ticket and then go inside and hand to someone (i think?) seemed
terrifying. i think i was about to go in some ramen shop following some
guy and observing what he did so i could flawlessly operate the machine
and copy the Social Script. But then i became afraid and left. I also
went into a burger king and tried to order on a Kiosk. It did not accept
my credit card. But i kept trying to pay with my credit card. and
eventually it just locked the kiosk or something and that was awkward
and i walked out of there. Eventually i seeked out a Matsuya, and
ordered ate food there.</p>

<h3>Ordering in <ruby>Matsuya<rt>松屋</rt></ruby></h3>
<p>matsuya became my safe space in japan. yummy food do not have to talk
to someone, only very basic interaction dont need words. terrific!
except one time which will come later.</p>
<p>But how does one Order In Matsuya? here i will document the process
for You.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>use the kiosk to order Food. you can pay with Cash or Credit or
OTHER FORMS OF payment as well though ive never used them. Some matuyas
my foreign credit card simply did not work i have no clue why so i used
cash.<sup>i personally would have used cash all the time if my credit
card did not charge cash withdrawal fees</sup></li>
<li>The kiosk will Print you some Tickets once u finish Order. Note that
if u order multiple things you may get MULTIPLE TICKETS make sure u get
all of them :). You can now Sit Down at a Seat, perhaps fetch Water or
Tea from the drink Machine probably in the store which is Self.</li>
<li>After waiting for a while, the store speaker system will go PIN PON
and call ur number in japanese and
<ruby><em><strong>カウンターへどうぞ</strong></em><rt>カウンターへどうぞ</rt></ruby>
and also it pops up on the monitors which are mounted in various
positions around the store.</li>
<li>go to counter and hand person ur ticket(s) and they look at them and
rip them and hand u back half of them and then u take ur food and sit
down and eat. note: usually they give u appropriate utensils but if u
need more , in my experience they are often at counter.</li>
<li>eat</li>
<li>put ur dishes in the dish return</li>
<li>leave</li>
</ol>
<p>note: this is how i did it and i might have did it wrong</p>

<p>it was very tasty i become a bit hungry look at picture.</p>
<p>After my meal i went around and walked around. I went into an
convenience store and bought an Alcohol, <ruby>チャミスル
マスカット<rt>chammy sul Muscat</rt></ruby>, and sour-cream-(and-onion?)
pringles. i picked this alcohol because i remember seeing its empty
bottles discarded in random places on street so far in my tokyo travels.
I drank it while walking around back to train station , it was very
sweet and tbh just tasted like uncarbonated grape soda.</p>

<p>In the morning I decide to go to Harajuku because that was one of the
other three places i heard about in tokyo before coming to tokyo. I
thought about trying to find thrift store and buy a pair of pants in
order to have Two pairs of pants so i can Wear one pair of pants while
Washing the other pair of pants. However i went to Harajuku and found
One thrift store but it was not yet open at that time of the day so i
kind of just Gave up on finding a thrift store and instead Wandered
around.</p>
<p>i do not really remember where i wandered , it was not very
memorable. i think i maybe walked through some kind of small park?. At
some point I accidentally wandered into “Takeshita street” which seemed
to be a major tourist attraction. there were lots of shops n stuff to
look at i looked at them. and then i ate at a mcdonalds. my order
was</p>

<p>the shrine was neat i guess. one thing i noticed is that whenever
someone walk out a Shrine Gate they turn around , face the shrine, and
bow to shrine. i kinda felt awkward and weird doing this but i also felt
awkward and weird not doing this, so i did some kind of half-assed
version when i felt nobody was around so i would not be forever cursed

<p>To Leave I boarded a train at <ruby>Harajuku<rt>原宿</rt></ruby>, or

up going there. But I actually don’t exactly remember if I knew where I
was going, and I don’t actually know how I decided what ticket to

anyways I ended up riding from <ruby>harajuku<rt>原宿</rt></ruby> (or
maybe <ruby>yoyogi<rt>代々木</rt></ruby>) station to
<ruby>tokyo<rt>東京</rt></ruby> station , clockwise on the
<ruby>yamanote<rt>山手</rt></ruby> line. i got off at tokyo station (not

seven-eleven which i think was labeled incorrectly it was more expensive

<p>and then they walked me through the process i understood like half of
what they said and nodded and stuff and paid and got my room. The room
was a couch-sofa room ? instead of a flat room like i was used to ,
maybe i missed something when going through process. This manboo felt a
little less nice the other ones i had been to i think , e.g. toilet room
smelled not too great , smoke smell was a bit stronger , sink faucet was
wobbly , also i just didnt really like the couch-sofa thing. But it was
okay . also they had a tenga-cup vending machine in the toilet room
which was interesting.</p>

<li>sit in front of TV watching japanese television while attempting for

without a mirror .
<ul>
<li>i believe<sup>(i think it was this night)</sup> there was a program
about making food out of discounted food products from
<ruby>DONQUIJOTE<rt>donki</rt></ruby>. it was very entertaining to me in
that moment . the content was interesting , but also half of the show
was just the reactions from these two people eating the food , and idk
how to describe it but the reactions were so fake but also so real but
also sort of like self-aware and yet a commentary on the social script
of needing to produce positive and interesting reactions. it felt like
the reactions were overblown yet everyone knew that and everyone knew
they were just following the script Yet they were still having fun and
they knew that everyone else know it was just the Social Script. it was
interesting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This night i received a formal Offer Letter of Employment from my
Potential Employer. i was expecting it and it finally arrived That
Night. It was nice to Finally Receive Employment Offer , but there was a
troublesome bit of news : which was i had to Take A Drug Test. if you
wish to read about this you may read about it in the below Aside.</li>

class="aside">
<h3>aside: accepting USA employment offer while homeless in japan</h3>
<p>So actually I booked my plane to Japan while in a
potential-employment situation with an Employer, which was approx this:
the employer said “we want to offer you employment but we have to do 300
paperwork and stuff so we will give u an offer letters and details
soon.” And i said OK, and then flew to japan (Aug 26), expecting that i
can handle employment acceptance things in Asia and come back to USA
around Sep 23 to start employment (i think Recruiter said to me that i
would probably start around sep 25).</p>
<p>the employment Offer Letter finally came this night , and it had at
least two concerning things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>it contained the words “As agreed, your first day will be
09/18/2023!”. excuse me brother i did not agree to that i did not even
hear about that</li>
<li>it said i had to complete a Background Check, and within two days
after filling out the Background Check i had to take a Drug Test. And
the Drug Test was with companies that seemed to only operate in the
USA.</li>
</ol>
<p>i was quite stressed thinking im gonna have to book a plane back to
USA in next few days potentially. i emailed recruiter , and phone called
them , And essentially they say: We can do background check later. But i
was in a mindset where if i dont get this background check done ASAP
they are gonna revoke employment offer or something or ill be shunned
from the workplace idk. So i replied umm i can probably fly back this
weekend. But recruiter said well ok ill check back with u next week if u
arent in usa thats fine we can delay background check. and i said
ok.</p>
<p>And then i consult with parents , and surprisingly my Father, despite
sending me novels of Concerned Texts concerning my employment throughout
my trip , seemed to say that it would be better to finish my trip in
East Asia. i interpret my father as the type of person to suggest that
you sacrifice ur life to climb corporate ladder, so it was strange that
he did not suggest that i come back to usa asap. Maybe because he wanted
me to come to Taiwan or something.</p>

</figure>
<p>so the next day after Receiving the Letter i decided that i Did want
to come back around 9/25, when i originally expected to come home. so i
sent email saying can i do background check Then pls. and they didnt
respond. so i bumped email. and they respond oop mb ill check with
People. and then no response for a few days bc weekend and “labor day”
holiday , and then finally got a response: yes that date is ok.
hooray!</p>

<p>This day i woke up and went to sinookubo Matsuya to eat midday meal .
however there was a person that was kind of taking a long time and i

sounded interesting to go to. So i took Train to i believe

<h3>aside: timing train rides</h3>
<p>from this day onwards i started sometimes timing train rides i took
by taking a picture of my ticket (which has a time printed on it) once i
arrived at my destination station. and then i just compare the time
printed on ticket with timestamp of photo i took.</p>
<p>in this case , i took a train from
<ruby>shinagawa<rt>品川</rt></ruby> to
<ruby>yokohama<rt>横浜</rt></ruby> ; the time printed on the ticket i
got at <ruby>shinagawa<rt>品川</rt></ruby> was 11:46 , and the photo
timestamp is 12:12. For a difference of 26 mins. in the future i will
use the notation <ruby>品川<rt>11:46</rt></ruby>
<ruby>→<rt>26</rt></ruby> <ruby>横浜<rt>12:12</rt></ruby> to Indicate
This.</p>

<p>ordering at this matsuya was an Experience for me. first i went in to
order at kiosk, the kiosk dont accept my credit card. At this point in
trip i had realised that my credit card charges Fee for cash withdrawals
so i wanted to Not Use Cash where i could. I saw that the kiosk accepted
other form of payments?so i left store to look up things , but either i
couldnt get wifi or i just gave up. I go to reenter then someone else
was using kiosk so i paced around outside bc it felt awkward to enter
and just stand in store. When they done i go use kiosk about to pay for
stuff , but then was adjusting order or sth and then Worker came over to
me and talking to me (in japanese) about like theres coupon or sth do u
want to use? ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm , i replied affirmatively or sth and
then they pressed some things and then asked me to enter sth and then i
wondered ohhh did i need to have a coupon?i thought they were just
giving me a coupon. so then i replied negatively or sth i think and then
they were like ummmmmmmmm oh..ok? uhh , well are u ok with this order?
and i replied affirmatively and and they say how u wanna pay and i press
cash or sth and they say <ruby>キャッシュ<rt>cash</rt></ruby> and my
tickets and change come out and i think they prob gesture to my ticket
and then they leave, but only before giving me the deepest bow , 90
degree bow , i had ever received , tbh i was shook ; frazzled ; confused
, however it was over . and i sat at counter booth and continued my
matsuya experience. i still wonder what they were thinking dealing with
that Silent and Confusing customer.</p>
<section id="tomato-juice" class="aside">
<h3>tomato juice</h3>
<p>i got a can of tomato juice from a Vending Machine and drank some of
it as i walked to the matsuya. and drank rest of it with my meal. it
would be weird to dispose of it by putting it on my tray and having
matsuya dispose of it, i thought. so i just put the empty can in my
pocket while returning my tray and then disposed it in a can disposal
sometime later somewhere idk where.</p>
</section>
<p>Then i walk back to Station and took a train to the Chinatown.</p>

<p>I entered a nearby Park that had Trees and a Body Of Water. And i sat
on a bench. There were a large gathering of Pigeons. Some Pigeons were
cleaning each other or some thing, which is first time i had seen that
behavior. Also many pigeons were Loafing around i.e. Resting in a shape
similar to a Loaf Of Bread on the Ground. this was Epic and they were
Cute and i took Pictures.</p>

<p>i sat in the park for a while. i was a bit tired. then i got up and
walked to another park located by a Harbour or Port or something ; it
was neat to see a Large Body of Water.</p>

having a performance and it was neat , though i did not take pictures bc
there were ppl holding signs and telling ppl not to photography.</p>

<p>While i was walking, I thought: maybe i should take a Ferry to
somewhere. because there was a Harbour Port thing right here, and i
wondered if i Could take a ferry somewhere. I think i was inspired by
that Suzume Japanese Animation i watched on the plane to Japan , in
which they Took a Ferry. But after looking things up , I concluded idk
what i was doing, so i did not take a Ferry.</p>
<p>I walked to an <ruby>無印良品<rt>muji</rt></ruby> Store because i
have formed a deep trust and emotional connection with the stores, and i
bought a pair of Short Pants which was on sale i believe. Then i walked
over to an Manboo in order to lodge in for the night , stopping by a
Convenience store along the way to buy Food to Eat for Dinner. Also i
stopped by a Vending machine and bought a JPY-100 drink with a JPY-1000
bill in order to get some JPY-100 coins. iirc it gave my change entirely
in JPY-100 coins which was great, but i thought i pressed a Water-Bottle
button but it gave me some kind of Lemon Drink.</p>

<p>Anyways i entered the Manboo and showed them my Phone Screen asking
pls give me room. they walked me through process , in japanese i think ,
they were giving me like a briefing of the rules and how everything
works i think ; i remember they asked me ‘<ruby>吸いますか<rt>does u
smoke</rt></ruby>’ and i replied negatively n stuff. and then came the
Payment or so and then i handed them my membership and then they was
like ohh u have the membership card lol , and then they gave me a
receipt which was only JPY200 for 30 mins and i dont actually pay then.
That confused me until i reread the prices sheet and at the top it says
(for members) it automatically charges the cheapest price (when u check
out i guess). That was interesting bc all the other manboo i went to i
just payed upfront , even though i think their price sheets also had
this automatic pricing thing (myb because i explicitly asked for the
package).</p>

<p>anyways i went to room and then showered with Coin Shower and then
put on my Newly Bought pants and go do laundry with Coin Laundry (there
was a Coin Laundry in this Manboo). i attempted to read the coin-laundry
instructions bc it seemed u needed to? could? run some kind of cleaning
cycle beforehand? or something? but i had no clue ; i put coins in and
it just started filling drum with water (and probably displayed a
timer?) so i just threw all my laundry in and left.</p>
<p>While laundry was going i put hot water in my Cup Noodles using a
hot-water dispenser , which i think was my first time using one of them
, and i was confused there was a ‘lock’ or something? i just pressed
things and eventually it worked. I was going to eat them but then i was
sort of confused because i passed a counter that said sth like ‘please
enjoy the food that we sell here’, and i was confused : did that mean i
shouldnt eat in my own room? i decided just eat in my room bc i assumed
I Could.</p>

<p>finished dinner , went to laundry , it seemed to be washed. i put it
in Drier. In My Room as clothing was drying i am not sure what i did. i
think i drank some <ruby>Shoutyuu<rt>焼酎</rt></ruby> that i was still
carrying around , in order to lighten my Bag of Stuff (this is not a
good reason for drinking alcohol, probably). also probably drank some
Lemon Drink i accidentally got from vending machine. And i think i was
thinking about , looking up things What To Do Where To Go Tomorrow?. I
remember retrieving my Laundry from Drier, then probably continuing
Sitting In My Room.</p>

<p>I think i looked up something about japan trains and was thinking
about Travelling West in Japan. I wrote in my Notes: “i think im want to
wake up at early then train across japan maybe.” But at some point i
accidentally fell asleep, probably because i was tired and also drowsy
from ingesting Alcohol. END OF day 5</p>

<h2 id="japan-day-6-atami-fuji">japan day 6 – atami, fuji</h2>
<p>I woke up around 2AM and realised i had accidentally fallen asleep. i
brushed my teeth , went back to sleep. Then woke up again around 5AM and
booked a hotel that was “cheap and didnt look too bad and was in
middleish of yokohama and <ruby>nagoya/kansai<rt>west places in
Japan</rt></ruby> and was near <ruby>mount fuji<rt>Mountain</rt></ruby>
and named seem strangely familiar idk” (quote by me writing in my notes
in the evening).</p>
<p>I checked out at exactly 6:29AM. And i checked in at exactly 6:30PM
the day before , and so i was charged for the 12HR pack (instead of the
15HR pack i assume?<sup>though i actually don’t know how the pricing
exactly works. Would i be charged the 12HR pack + some extra minutes?
LMK in the comments section if u know how Manboo Pricing System Works
:)</sup>). So it cost only JPY 2000 (instead of potentially 2500).
Hooray!</p>
<p>I ate a Morning Meal at a nearby Matsuya. i always wanted to have a
Breakfast Set thing at matsuya so i Did. It was tasty and only cost
JPY500 nice!.</p>

<p>i walked to the nearby JR-EAST <ruby>関内駅<rt>kannai
station</rt></ruby>. I was not completely sure what Trains i could take
West. However i read online or something you could just take “local
trains” completely to <ruby>Oosaka<rt>Famous Big Urban Area West Of
Here</rt></ruby> (“local” meaning umm Normal, not high-speed trains.
Just like Trains that transport u around a city. except it transports u
Between cities.) So, I bought the highest-value ticket available, and
then i Boarded a Train Intending to go to the farthest-west station
listed on the Fare Map that seemed to be connected The West of japan
(i.e. <ruby>沼津<rt>numadu</rt></ruby>).</p>

<p>I rode The Train. On The train, i was looking at the Map and stuff,
and i saw i would go through a station called
<ruby>熱海<rt>atami</rt></ruby>, which sounded Enticing. chinese
character mean like Hot Sea? Scorched Sea? warm sea?? idk but it sounded
cool, esp because i like Beaches, and i saw they had a Beaches.</p>
<p>I think the train i was riding stopped at
<ruby>Atami<rt>熱海</rt></ruby> so i had to get off and transfer to
another westward train. But i was too enticed and so i left the gates
(wasting JPY350 in fare) to walk around. I visited a Beach which felt
like the most artificial man-made beach ever created</p>

<p>It had some kind of barriers so the water was very calm which i
personally was not a big fan of. It also a vending machine with the most
expensive pocari sweat i had seen in ; most pocari i saw in vending
machines was JPY 170~180; this pocari was above 200. which was
interesting because i think it was first time i had seen that much
difference in typical vending machine prices (all were about the
same).</p>
<section id="vending-machine-prices-in-japan" class="aside">
<h3>vending machine prices in japan</h3>
<p>whenever i passed by a vending machine in japan i usually looked at
the prices and selection. i have concluded that vending machine prices
are remarkably uniform across Where I Went, including more rural places.
Sometimes some areas may have Cheap Machines selling stuff at like
JPY100, 110, but this is because they are selling their own (cheaper)
drinks. If u look at the price of sth like: Coca Cola, i think it does
not vary much beyond like 1, 2, 3 tens of cents across all the areas i
visited. As a side-note, drinks at JPY100 were generally rare, and i
encountered probably less than 10 total machines ever selling drinks
below JPY100.ds</p>
</section>
<p>However, the beach was ok and perhaps even nice. because it was a
beach i like beaches. I soon left the beach and walked back to the
station</p>

<p>And then i boarded westward train. it final stop was at a station
where i had to get off and transfer to another westward train.</p>
<section id="different-train-carriages-seating" class="aside">
<h3>different train carriages seating</h3>
<p>on my westward train journey i discovered that sometimes a train has
different Train Carriage Types, and that you can Pay to ride a more
comfy Seats or something. I believe the stations will mark Where these
carriages will stop, but i did not see these markings. so i accidentally
got on one once.</p>
<p>There are also regular commuter-style carriages which are the
standard seats-lining-wall. There are also sometimes front/back facing
seats , which u can switch to face Front/Back by pulling it up.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">heres a picture of front/back facing

<p>Often there will be seats that end up facing each other , a very
awkward configuration in which there are technically Four seats but its
kinda weird to sit Directly Across from someone or Right Next to them so
u have one person sit in one corner and the other person sits in the
diagonally-opposite corner.</p>

(<ruby>熱海<rt>11:54</rt></ruby> <ruby>→<rt>57</rt></ruby>

a <ruby>無印良品<rt>muji</rt></ruby> Store intending to buy a backpack.
i walked through some kind of industrial area for a little more than an
hour to get to The Store; it was definitely New Scenery. There was
really Nobody There except me and Passing-By Cars and People working in
Industrial Building Things.</p>

<p>The Store was in a small little shopping center with large parking

Store bought a backpack , and a little organizing pouch thing. I took my
purchases out the store and squatted in the Shopping Center Storefront
organizing my Belongings into the Backpack and stuff.</p>
<p>Once i was done, i set off to my Hotel i booked in the morning. I
could have taken a train at nearby train station, but i decided to save
a few hundred JPY and also see more of the area by Walking. I walked for
quite a while , like 2 hours. headed in wrong direction a few times ,
observed the scenery and Looked at Things.</p>

<li>say something unintelligible so employee knows idk what im

<li>give them passport , and they make a photocopy (idk why but all

<p>i remember it as being OK. in my notes i wrote that it was “kinda
musty”. i sat in hotel room a bit charging my phone and writing a
follow-up email to Employment Recruiter person that had not responded to
my email. Then i went out to walk around Town and find Dinner.</p>

<p>I end up go to an convenience store, a Lawson. I bought a Big cup
noodle, a hamburg steak Lunch Box, and a 2L bottle of water. I was
slightly anxieteous because this was first time going to a Lawson, esp
one outside a big city. However there was nothing out of the ordinary
and i think the only interaction i had to do was reply negatively to Do
You Need A Bag or so.</p>

<p>I went back to hotel , i bought a suntory ‘highball’ from an alcohol
vending machine in the hotel lobby (JPY 200). I took a bath , it felt
very nice , and they provided a ‘bath sponge’ , so i could Exfoliate
mine skin well. It Was Now Dinner time!!!!!</p>

<p>the dinner was yummy. the “suntory high ball” i got from hotel lobby
I was not a big fan of , it tasted like whiskey mixed with some kind of
sweet beverage. also i drank some leftover lemon drink i got on accident
in yokohama that i poured my leftover <ruby>syoutyuu<rt>焼酎</rt></ruby>
in.</p>
<p>idk when but i remember i accidentally fell into a little (probably
alcohol-induced) nap , likely while Watching the Television. but i woke
up, brush teeth and things, went to sleep. END OF DAY 6</p>

<h2 id="shizuokanagoyagifu">7: shizuoka,nagoya,gifu</h2>
<p>This day i got up and then booked some kind of Hotel around
<ruby>Nagoya<rt>名古屋</rt></ruby>, the city which i planned to Go To by
the end of the day. Then i checked out hotel. To check out i just
dropped key in a Box at the Front , which felt weird bc i thought i
would need to talk to someone but I think that was all i needed to do i
guess. i dont think there was anyone at desk.</p>
<p>My hotel was like 10 Meter away from the train station so i think i
just took train as soon as left hotel. I decided to go to
<ruby>SHIZUOKA<rt>静岡</rt></ruby>. Why? I think i looked at google maps
and seemed to be a large Settlement between Me and
<ruby>Nagoya<rt>名古屋</rt></ruby> (the place i plan to visit at end of
day). Also i was watching Television yesterday and one of the channels
was named “TV Shizuoka” or something, so i assumed it was some sort of
Representative Of This Area<sup>now that i look it up, Shizuoka is the
Capital City of the Region (called Shizuoka), however it is only its
Second-Most-Populous city. oops!</sup>. So, i rode the train to
<ruby>Shizuoka<rt>静岡</rt></ruby> (<ruby>富士<rt>10:00</rt></ruby>
<ruby>→<rt>80</rt></ruby> <ruby>静岡<rt>11:20</rt></ruby>).</p>

<p>In shizuoka, my plan was to Walk to a matsuya to Eat my midday meal ,
enjoying any Scenery and Things i passed by. I passed through a Park
which was scenic i guess. But when i arrived at the Matsuya I was scared
by</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>there was a parking lot (idk why , but this felt off-putting. maybe
because none other matsuya i had been to had a parking lot.)</li>
<li>The restaurant layout seemed to be a sort of open-air Counter thing
like u might see at a Ramen shop. in other words there is Someone right
in front of u doing things as u Eat your Meal probably.</li>
</ol>
<p>So i did not go in. I walked back to Station and ordered McDonalds
and ate McDonalds.</p>

<p>And then i just left Shizuoka, idrk why i didnt stay longer , maybe
bc already past midday and i wanted to have time to look around Nagoya
or sth? In retrospect, i think i should have walked North of Shizuoka
Station bc on Google Maps there seems to be many interesting Things
there.</p>

<p>Anyways i took the train to <ruby>Nagoya<rt>名古屋</rt></ruby>
(<ruby>静岡<rt>12:39</rt></ruby> <ruby>→<rt>187</rt></ruby>
<ruby>名古屋<rt>15:46</rt></ruby>), which took kind of a while (it was
long distance and involved a transfer or two). For a bit i had the
intention to visit some kind of Sand Dunes in
<ruby>HAMAMATU<rt>浜松</rt></ruby>(?), but then looking on the map i
realised there was no train there , walking was likely infeasable, and i
would have to take Bus or sth which i was too scared to do. So i just
continued on to Nagoya.</p>
<p>According to photo timestamps, i (probably) arrived in
<ruby>Nagoya<rt>名古屋</rt></ruby> around 15:46, but i think i only made
it out the Station Gates around 16:15. Why? i had a JPY-1340 ticket from
<ruby>Shizuoka<rt>静岡</rt></ruby> Which was not enough money worth to
go from shizuoka to <ruby>Nagoya<rt>名古屋</rt></ruby>. If you go
through Gate with that ticket at Nagoya it will go BEEEE dont let u
through give u back ur ticket. So i take it to the “Fare Adjustment”
machine to pay the difference. However It Didnt Work for me. it say
sorry cant do this bro, please take to station attendant. However i
really did not want to take it to a station attendant. so i just walked
around the inner station for a while and tried another fare machine (it
didnt work) and watched People passing by for a bit. Until i finally
Just Went and Took it to station attendant, saying the words (in
english) “Fare Adjustment”. The station guy then said the words “静岡”
and then appeared to do some Calculations and stuff, and then showed me
a calculator with a Number. And i payed the number in JPY (i think it
was 2000Some money, though don’t exactly remember) , and left (there was
no receipt or anything i just handed over the money).</p>

<p>After i got out of Nagoya Station i dont think i had any particular
Plans , i just walked around and looked at things. browsed a
<ruby>DONQUIJOTE<rt>Donkey</rt></ruby> i believe. Went to a very narrow
Park thing which had a large Tower thing. Once when walking on the Road
Sidewalk thing, i saw a guy holding a Sign looked like he was Soliciting
Business for something. I did not want to potentially interact, so I
turned to cross the Street instead of continuing Straight. but they
WALKED UP TO ME and i was shooked . i assumed a Negative Posture like
shook my head no thanks or something body language. But then they
pointed to a brochure sticking out of my backpack side pocket and said
(in japanese) did u go to tokyo? and then i replied (internally) oh yeah
haha By using body language that was probably something like Nodding.
They replied sth like “how was it?” and i replied sth like Thumbs Up and
Smile. And they said sth like “I’m (from) Gifu”. And tbh i would have
not known what they was saying except that in the morning i booked my
Hotel thing in Gifu (place near Nagoya) so i knew the name. So i tried
to communicate “ohhhh!!” in body language which was probably sth like
making an “ohhhh!!” facial expression and nodding in recognition. And
then they finished the ‘conversation’ with sth like “make sure to visit
one day, hehe”. and i nodded probably. And then they left. Overall it
was a very Wholesome interaction (at least for me) and i will remember u
Gifu Guy thx!!.</p>
<section id="aside-solicitors-in-japan" class="aside">
<h3>aside: solicitors in Japan</h3>
<p>in Japan there is often people in Streets holding Flyers or similar
thing trying to Solicit people. In my experience these Solicitors are
Quite Intense. Here is Two experience i Have with them that Make me
Think so.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>in Akihabara there is many Solicitors dressed in Interesting
Costumes ; I Try to Avoid , however once i passed One in which it would
be kind of Too Obvious that i was Avoiding them , so i simply Took the
flyer because i feel bad for declining Fliers , and i think There is Not
Much Trouble for Taking someone’s Flyers (i once tried handing out
Fliers at mine University , and it was always Pleasanter Than Not when
someone Took a flier). However once i Took the flier (idk if i even took
the flier ; i might have just Reached Out for the flier) , the person
Initiated Dialogue, which initiated my Flight or Flight response. and my
mental state was ‘0:’ while i sort of tried to continue Walking , but
then the person continued Dialogue , asking “where are u going” (in
japanese) , idk if this was a “where are u going? i am curious hehe
because i am making conversation” or a “excuse me where are u going u
were accepting my Flier , please interact with me in regards to my
related Business”. In order to Escape this Situation, i Continually used
Body language indicating “Good Bye” and Furthered the Distance between
myself and Them in the Direction i was Heading , until it appeared they
had Let me Go.</li>
<li>in <ruby>SinOokubo<rt>新大久保</rt></ruby> , there was someone
Passing out Fliers on kind of a narrow Sidewalk so i just Took the flier
bc it felt Natural to. I guess i did not learn from Akihabara, or i just
assumed that Akihabara Solicitors were Built Different. However This
Solicitor As Well Initiated Dialogue and then somehow got me to Step
into the Establishment which was like some kind of Art Showroom and then
they were Dialoguing me and i dont remember what they said ; i dont
think i understood most of what they said , and they figured this out ,
and then they asked me (in english i think) Where are u From or sth and
i used the same technique of Good-Bye body language while Leaving to
Eventually Leave.</li>
</ol>
<p>in summary, dont take the flier unless u are Actually Interested in
Japan. maybe the solicitors are not “intense” so much as They Think U
Actually Are Interested So Why would you Just Take Flier then Walk Away.
this is my Thoughts.</p>

<p>Eventually i arrived at my Hotel which was not really “Hotel” in
typical Large High Rise Run By Large Corporation , it was more kind of
like Someone turned their House into a Place u can Stay. In fact they
marketed themselves as “<ruby>ryokan<rt>旅館</rt></ruby>” i believe
which tbh idk what that is but translating it says “Japanese Inn”.</p>
<p>When i arrive, it is nobody There, only a Front Desk. So i just stood
around for a while. and looked around. And nobody come. So i went
outside and looked at Outside. And then Came back in and Stood around
for a bit more. And eventually a Guy came out some Hallway and asked sth
like “are u ジェームズファング様” and i Affirmed and they led me into
some Kitchen and they led me to a Table and pulled out a Chair and
gestured (and maybe Told?) me to sit so i Sat and looked around while i
think they went in the back and got some stuff . Oh they also asked me
um “did you walk here?” (first in Japanese but i didnt understand so
then they said in english sth like “Walk”). And i affirmed and then they
gave me a Sweet Muscat Sparkling beverage as Service.</p>
<p>The vibe was quite interesting , sort of like i was about to get a
Firm Talking-To by an Friendly Uncle or something (the person looked
like a Friendly Uncle). And then they brought over to me umm i think
like my reservation information printed on paper or something? and then
sort of showed me things? and maybe asked me things? i remember once
they asked me sth like “<ruby>旅行ですか<rt>R u on trip</rt></ruby>” ,
and i was confused bc i could not comprehend
<ruby>旅行<rt>ryoKou</rt></ruby> , and then they said sth like
<ruby>難しいね<rt>this is difficult ne</rt></ruby> while fetching a pen
from the back room , came back , and then wrote the characters 旅 行 on
the paper (ig they assumed i was Chinese and so could read the
Characters). Idk if i actually knew the characters, but i understood it
more than Verbal, and i sort of understood and/or inferred, and then
Affirmed. then they asked for my passport and to make a copy of it so i
handed it over and then they come back , give me my key and show me
around the Inn , showing where my room, shower, toilets were. And so
ended the check-in process.</p>

<li>Turn on TV and watching a few mins and turning it off</li>

<p>in my Travels in Japan , i tended to judge Pricing for Lodging like
this:</p>
<ul>
<li>JPY 2000: cheap</li>
<li>JPY 3000: OK, though i wish i could book something like JPY2500
instead.</li>
<li>JPY 4000: umm</li>
<li>JPY 5000: expensive</li>
</ul>
<p>and I tended use the Rough Conversion of JPY100 = USD 1 when Judging
Prices, so JPY 100 “felt” like USD1 (even though i knew it was slightly
Under USD1). Staying in InternetCafe (Manboo) for first part of trip, i
was used to paying approx 2-3k JPY per night. And when i started Booking
Hotels, i found that you could usually find Cheap Hotels only Slightly
More Expensive, i think around 3-4k (if u book on the same day) (Varies
by Region, a lot) (Weekends seem to be More Expensive).</p>
<p>According to my Records, This Night’s stay was the Most expensive,
costing JPY5067 = USD36.55 . however Retrospectively in the context of
This Trip i think it was worth it bc it was Not Just Another Large Chain
Hotel Thing That Is About Same As Every Other Hotel; it was more
Japanese Style Cute Room and Friendly Uncle Guy.</p>
<p>I probably could have stayed in Cheaper Lodgings if i had stayed in
Guesthouse Thing where multiple people sleep in same room, but i was too
scared to try those .</p>

<p>I woke up , visited the Sink and stuff, and then gathered my Things
and Left the Hotel, leaving my Key at the Front Desk (next to someone
else’s)</p>

<p>I Walk out the Hotel heading back towards Where i came from , the
Friendly Uncle Guy come out and Communicate me some kind of Farewell
greetings and also inform me that there is Bus Stop nearby if wish to
take it.</p>
<p>I continued walking. I passed the Smaller Local-Train (西大垣駅)
Station that i was intending to Ride back to the JR station. However
from a brief Scan of the station , it seemed that there were No
Automatic Gates , but instead a Human that would Check Tickets??. so i
did not take the train , instead Walking back to the JR station.</p>

<p>in Kyoto i do not remember having any particular Plans. i ended up
going to an Old Building area (i believe it was a temple..?). I remember
that it felt very Comfortable and Relieving to my Feet to walk
Barefoot(with socks) across a Large Room that was floored with um that
japanese flooring. i probably wandered around a
<ruby>DonQuijote<rt>ドン・キホーテ</rt></ruby> , and a department store,
and i also ate Burger King for dinner.</p>

<p>eventually i went to my Booked Hotel. Funny story i got panhandled in
kyoto station. i was standing in front of the ticket machine and looking
up at the Fare Map to verify that i needed a JPY190 ticket , and an old
guy comes up to me and says something in Japanese tbh i dont remember
and didnt fully Know what he said , except i made out
‘<ruby>100円<rt>HYAKUEN</rt></ruby>’ and they was holding out their
Ballcap. so i gave them the JPY100 coin i was holding and they probably
said thx bro or sth and left and i wondered what just happened then
bought my ticket and left.</p>
<p>Anyways i trained and walked to Hotel, where i checked in. I remember
this check-in was more awkward than usual. i do not remember the
details, but after i finished the process , i turned and walked towards
Vending Machines to buy a can of Beer , and the employee that just
checked me in and said sth , i think to the effect of “amenities in
room”? idk what they meant with that like was there free Beer in room?
or were they assuming i was going to buy amenities from the Vending
Machines (i dont remember if there were Amenities in the Vending
Machines)? im not sure , but i did an “oh ok” and then left to go to my
room. This was probably actually Best for my Liver bc i now see that i
had been drinking Every Day since Day 2 (or Day 1 if it includes the
plane over).</p>
<section id="aside-drinking-ethanol" class="aside">
<h3>aside: Drinking Ethanol</h3>
<p>I do not endorse Ingesting Alcoholic Beverages. Alcohol can be seen
around the World in many different Cultures with many different People
holding different Attitudes towards Alcohol. Tbh Alcohol seems to be a
bit Cringe. Alcohol and the people and customs and traditions
surrounding Alcohol may occasionally be Interesting. However the fact
that Alcohol is BAD for your Body and often plays a role in Destructive
Behaviours Makes me Judge Alcohol as being “Mostly Cringe”.</p>
<p>This being said , i did ingest quite a bit of Alcohol on this Trip.
However i would like to re-state my assertion that Drinking Alcohol is a
Self-Destructive Behaviour that is Overall Cringe.</p>

<p>The room did not have beer , but it was big and had a nice Bathtub
and Kitchen-area and also a whole Washing Machine.</p>

<p>i took bath , and then tried out the Washing Machine with a few
articles of Clothing because it looked Cool ; it even had a Drying
feature (despite being a Washing Machine). However i did not Add Laundry
Detergent (bc i didnt have any) , and that Wasn’t a good idea bc the
edges of the drum got all crusty with laundry grime. Oops!!!. i tried to
wash it out by running a cleaning cycle with Shampoo but it didn’t
really wash out well.</p>
<p>That was awkward so i went to sleep. END OF DAY 8</p>

buildings or so. I trained to an Area where i first ate Matsuya.</p>

it was kind of underwhelming and also it said dont take photographs so i
just left.</p>

<p>Then i wondered what to do, and so i decided to go to
‘<ruby>吉田寮<rt>yoshida dorm</rt></ruby>’, an kyoto-university
Dormitory that a friend always mentioned whenever i bring up Japan
because they thought it looked cool. But before i did that, i stopped by
a nearby <ruby>Convenience store<rt>familymart</rt></ruby> and bought a
cold Bottle of Tea and an Umbrella, the Tea to drink and the Umbrella to
shield mineself from the Sun. I also walked for like 1 min in some
shrine area which had a lot of people walking around.</p>
<section id="aside-my-umbrella" class="aside">
<h3>aside: my umbrella</h3>
<p>i initially bought My Umbrella to use as a Parasol. I was thinking in
the back of my head for a while whether to buy one or not. here were my
concerns:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>i dont wanna carry that around with me for rest of entire trip</li>
<li>I think my surroundings in Life seemed to suggest that using a
Parasol was a Feminine concept i.e. Not Very For Those That Identified
Themself as an “Male”. For example, i remembered that there is “Parasol
Lady” NPCs in Pocket-monster Video games, but no “Parasol NotLady”. also
most of the people carrying around Parasols i saw was Females.</li>
</ol>
<p>here is how i resolved my concerns</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>there was a very small 98-gram Umbrella so carrying around it
shouldnt be much of a problem</li>
<li>i told myself again that it is silly to associate something like
Being able to carry around an Object with some kind of Larger Identity,
Identity is Stupid, Society is Stupid, and also i think i saw some old
guys walking out a temple holding Parasols. so i no longer Cared.</li>
<li>also i was hot and noticed that Shade made it noticeably Less
Hot.</li>
</ol>
<p>so i bought My Umbrella it served me well during throughout this Trip
including the Next Countries.</p>

kind of weirded out if tourists randomly walked in My university
dormitory. so i just took picture of entrance then Walked On.</p>
<p>However i thought: well i may or may not be in Japan for the entire
rest of my Life and the Pictures i saw online Did like sort of
interesting so maybe i should just take a peek inside ; i maybe sort of
look like a potential student and its not like im gonna enter someones
actual rooms/building n stuff.</p>
<p>So i walked in and briefly looked around. there looked to be some
kind building u had to go in to go further (now that i look at google
maps, i think its the actual main dorm building). and there was a guy
smoking in front of it and i already felt weird being inside the Walls
so i just left.</p>

then i walked into a Shrine or so right next to the university. It was
quite nice because it was Quiet with no people. Then i saw an enticing

walked around a little mountain area it was nice. i eventually walked
out the little mountain on the other side, ending up in some kind of

</figure>
<p>At this point idrked what to do. I looked at Google Maps and saw
there was a lot of Shrine/Temple things along the East where the City
met the Mountains. So, i decided to Walk down that area, stopping by the
ShrineTemples as i went , eventually reaching a Subway station.</p>
<p>So i started by walking to this large Temple thing that even has its
own icon on Google Maps, which was led to by this long touristy street.
There i used a little gumball gacha machine to get a random
Kyoto-souvenir Pin ; tbh i hoped i would get like a Train i think but i
ended up getting some kind of Temple that idked.</p>
<p>I then went to the big Temple but you had to Pay to get in so i didnt
go in. Instead i started my Southward Walk along an area where City met
Mountain. it was ok, but all the ShrineTemple things i passed by there
were People noises and People which discouraged me from going in.
Instead i just kept walking South.</p>
<p>At one point i took this long detour walking up some street to a
random Temple. there was not much to see at the Temple except that i
walked a bit into the woods behind the Temple and ran into several
Spider webs. Luckily i dont think i physically Touched a spider but i
did see some chonky-looking Spiders that idk and i dont really want to k
were Venemous or not</p>

across a sign with an Arrow , and the phrase “Steep and bad path” ,
pointing to some kind of Shrine or so. how Enticing! it said it would
only take 30 Mins as well. So, i headed That Way.</p>

蹴上 to <ruby>Kyoto<rt>京都</rt></ruby> station bc didnt know where to
transfer. Also at Kyoto station it seemed like there was an Express
train to <ruby>大阪<rt>OOSAKA</rt></ruby>.. but at a platform different
from the one that was labelled “to oosaka”?? which confused me. So i
ended up taking a local train to oosaka, however midway i decided it was
too slow and wanted to take the Express train. So i got of at a
transferable station and Went to the Express train (which for reference
Was on a Different Platform).</p>

thing i noticed was that People occasionally Crossed Crosswalks even
when they were Red , which i did not observe in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I decided to Walk to my Hotel bc i was planning to stop by a Matsuya
on the way to Eat Dinner , and if i do that im basically already At the
Nearest Train Station To Hotel. So, i went to a Matsuya. However looking
into the Window, the vibes seemed very Off , like it was some kind of
Bar where Groups of people were Standing around Tables. That was kind of
terrifying , so i went to a Different one which looked more Normal.</p>
<p>However after I Ordered at the Kiosk i noticed Something was Off .
There was like someone Coming Around Serving customers or something
Bringing over Food or something???? , and then someone Came Over to my
Table , and then Took my Tickets and Ripped them and Went Away. it was a
bit Unfamiliar and Scary tbh , but i sat there and waited , and then
they brang over Food and i Ate it. and then from what i observe , you
just Leave ur stuff at table and someone would come over and clean it
up. so i did that. and left.</p>

<p>I walked to hotel , on the way stopped by a
<ruby>Convenience<rt>store</rt></ruby> and bought a bag of shrimp snack
and some Beer. at the Hotel i took a Bath and then enjoyed a Snack while
observing what was being broadcasted onto the Television. I accidentally
spilled the bag of Shrimp Snack because i hit it with my Phone Charging
Cable. However luckily much of it landed on some Clothes i had on a
chair , which i felt comfortable eating off of. Thus i only lost about ,
according to a picture i took, around 28 puffed Shrimp Snacks. The beer
tastes were not very Noteworthy.</p>
<p>The hotel room , which i dont have any good pictures of, was not
particularly noteworthy. It was clean and did not have any bad smells
iirc, and was only USD23.85 (booked night before) and had a Bathtub and
was in the City so i was satisfied. i do not really remember what i did
at the Hotel in the Night besides snack , observe Television, charge
phone, probably brush Teeth and go to Bed.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">9.5 10:43 GMT+9: the burger</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>the food was good ig it tasted about like what was expected. the
overall Visit i remember felt a bit awkward though , When my order came
out the person said sth about chicken nuggets and i dont think i
understood and then they said something in english about chicken nuggets
havent come out or sth so sit down and we will bring them to u and i
tried to communicate sth like “no its ok i can wait i want to wait bc i
dont want to have someone come over” (which i probably communicated by
saying sth like “Wait”) and then they replied sth like “no just sit down
bro” so i sat down staring at my food and then someone came over and
gave me my chicken nuggets. and then i decided to sit upstairs, but the
only nonawkward spot to sit seemed to be right near the bathrooms ,
which u could smell. so i went to the Upstairs Upstairs which there
absolutely nobody which was nice ig, except one time when someone came
up and went into employee room and ig got ready to work and came out and
went back downstairs, which doesn’t really contain any inherent
awkwardness but idk i kind of felt weird Knowing that the Person walked
up three flights of stairs to see someone eating alone in the very top
floor of a Wendy’s, but it was probably just a very normal Day in the
Life for them ig. my vibe was also sort of depressing bc someone told me
sth like “osaka is known for good food places u should go to some hehe”
and i said yeah haha ok and then went to Wendy’s bc i was too afraid to
try anything else and potentially talk to an irl human.</p>
<p>after finishing my Wendy’s i basically just walked around ‘Shopping’
for the rest of the day. there were very large Commercial areas lots of
People in these covered sort of Outlet Mall things , and there were
Department Stores, etc. i searched for a while to find this very
specific little <ruby>赤べこ<rt>akabeko</rt></ruby> bobblehead cow gacha
machine that i had encountered once before and thought would be a nice
souvenir for an Family member. i Found it. i Browsed around more just
for fun. i used like two other Gacha machines bc i figured i wasnt going
to come back to Japan (at least in a while) so go Crazy. also stopped by
the good ol <ruby>無印良品<rt>muji</rt></ruby> and bought socks (both
the pairs i had brought had large holes in them by now), some nifty
charging-cable retainers that i had seen earlier, and a small notebook
and pen which i planned to used to record Details of my Travels but
Wrote In Twice And Never Used Again.</p>
<p>Overall not very exciting ; no opportunities to get Rabies or Snap my
Ankle. the most memorable thing was maybe guy that was busking(?) by
posing as spiderman statue(?) and had a sign saying (in both japanese
and english) that their dream was to open restaurant.</p>

that night that That <ruby>convenience<rt>store</rt></ruby> checkout was
perhaps the longest and most involved, checkout experience i had had Yet
in japan while feeling Comfortable (it involved responding negatively to
“do you need a bag”, and then showing my Credit card and them saying
“Card” and me responding affirmatively or so and paying with Card.)</p>

<p>Back at the Hotel i Washed myself and ate my Snacks. The hotel room
was slightly nicer than usual (idk if this is bc i payed more [USD
34.95] and so i wanted to think it was nicer); it came with free Bottled
Water and had a little plastic Protector around the TV remote, and the
Bathroom had a slightly-larger-than-average bathtub. however it was
quite Hot and i couldnt find an air-conditioning remote, and the
information on the TV system thing said sth like “we cant change
individual room climate sorry bro”, so i assumed there was no personal
air-conditioning? and maybe my room was just Hot because it was right
next to a large Hole opening to the neighbouring Empty Construction Lot.
I was Sweating it was pretty hot and i figured i was just going to have
a very sweatful sleep , until i went to turn off the lights via some
kind of Digital Panel next to the bed and notice there was a Temperature
Control on it . which controlled the Airconditioning. oops! i turned it
on and it was cool and i went to bed. END OF DAY 10</p>

<h2 id="japan-day-11-kix">japan day 11 – KIX</h2>
<p>my Flight to Taiwan was at 8:55 this morning departing from KIX ; i
searched up approx train trip time night before and woke up at 5:30 ,
took Trains and arrived at 7:16. Note on trains: i saw one train called
‘Rapi:t β’(?) which traveled where i needed it to travel, however they
had some kind of Ticket Machines for it? within the station? so i
assumed it was more Expensive you have to buy an Extra ticket to ride
it, so i did not ride it when it arrived (many other people that looked
like they were going to the airport did not ride it, so i felt safe not
riding it).</p>
<p>Checkin at airport was stand in a line and then talk to a person. It
turns out i couldn’t Check In without a Future plane ticket Out of
Taiwan (proof of onward flight?), which was awkward bc i didnt have one.
so i left, sat on floor , booked a flight from Taiwan to South Korea,
and returned to the Desk where the person directed me back to the same
Counter and Finished the Checkin.</p>
<p>the Airport security was very chill ; there were no large
person-scanning XRAY machines (just Metal Detectors or so) and you didnt
have to take off shoes. i was through there in no time !!</p>
<p>i bought rice balls and bottle of Tea from
<ruby>convenience<rt>store</rt></ruby> at my gate , and then sat on my
phone watching youtube . I almost missed my boarding because i had
earphones in and was sitting kind of far away from my gate, with my back
towards it. I only noticed when looking at my phone time in the corner
that boarding time was Now ; i turned around and saw the entire gate
waiting area was Empty ; and i jogged over to the boarding as they were
literally calling my name bro where are u.</p>
<p>END OF JAPAN</p>
