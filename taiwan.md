# taiwan

i spent 7 days in Taiwan because my Father was going to be in Taiwan during that time , and i could just stay with him (and his brother i.e. my uncle). This trip ended up basically just being me following them around. i did not have much creative input in the Trip (maybe i Could have if i had said something, but i did not say anything).

Because I didn't have much creative say in the trip, i kind of do not feel much Excitement trying to Recall all the Details. The details also involves details about Family Members which I don't feel comfortable writing onto the Internet. So, I will describe my Trip in Taiwan very Generally.

## taiwan day 1 -- taipei

on the Plane to Taiwan i ate a Rice ball i bought in KIX and then was gonna drink some Tea but then a cabin attendant stopped me and said something in (i think) mandarin, which i had no clue bc i know like 3 words of mandarin. i looked confused and then they said "japanese?" and i replied "english" and then they told me in english that i cant eat outside food, or bring it on in the first place(?). oops!. so i did not drink my tea.

plane arrived in Taiwan (TPE) at 10Something AM. i ate my remaining rice ball and drank Tea when arrived. Father met me at the Airport and gave me a Transportation/IC card that he bought for me ahead of time. thanks dad!. We took train back to the 'AirBnB' (AirBnB = to my understanding, Person Rents out their Spare Properties via App, lol) that my Dad and Uncle staying in in Taipei City. i should have not dranken as much tea as i did in airport bc the train ride was long.

Dad and Uncle and i went out ate some noodles at some small restaurant around the area. it was neat!. The atmosphere and vibe of Taiwan was very different from what i was used to in Japan.

Then we went to visit some Relatives a short Train ride away. I then sat among the Relatives in their Living room and the Relatives talked to my Father and Uncle. i had no clue what they were talking about for 95% of the time (i think they were speaking in some mixture of Taiwanese and Mandarin; i know 0 Taiwanese and 1 Mandarin). I basically just stared off into space except for a few times when one of them stopped to interact with me for some reason or another. Once they asked me if i wanted to leave to shop for Work Clothing(?) (dad was worried that i did not have appropriate Clothing for my Future Potential Employment). Once one of them showed me some travel guide about some Taiwan Night market (in english) and gave me the WiFi password. But for the most part i just sat there and did nothing , blending in with the couch.

We all then went to Dinner at an Restaurant. a Younger relative around My Age showed up at the Restaurant and Ate with us. the Older relatives kept trying to get That Younger Relative to practise their English with me i think. Funnily enough i dont think a single time on this trip i was asked to try to speak Mandarin.

In summary, this day i met some Relatives that i had never seen before in my life. My tendancy to not Talk in general combined poorly with the Language Barrier and i awkwardly talked minimally to the Relatives.

## taiwan day 2 -- taipei

In morning Uncle and Father (further abbreviated as UF) and i went out walk around, bought food to eat as breakfast. i had unsweetened soy milk and some Rice Ball Roll that i will eat as a leftover in future.

Then we went to large Taiwan museum. the centerpiece of the entire Museum was this Carving of Cabbage, and secondarily a Carving of Braised Pork Belly. The museum gift shop contained mostly Souveniers involving Cabbage. Also despite being called sth like "national palace museum", there was no Subway directly to the Museum, which was strange imo. UF thought to take a Bus but then i think was too long to wait or sth so took a taxi. However, took a bus back.

Eventually , Uncle and i went back to AIRBNB while father went to purchase something somewhere. In the AIRBNB, Uncle said to me something like "just a suggestion but when ur in a company u should project your voice and say things when you want to say them because nobody cares/nobody will ask if you have something to say". to which i replied "Ok thanks" or so, though i felt irritated and later at night writing in notes theorizing how growing up with this kind of environment caused me to hate talking or sth lol (my dad has said same type of things to me a lot). A large part of this Taiwan trip was being slightly off-put by things UF said/did.

At night UF and i went to some department store to buy 'work clothing' i think. I think Dad just assumed i needed the clothing, and idk what we would have done otherwise. So we went.

We went to a [無印良品](muji) and looked at some clothes. I didn't want to try on Pants (you had to interact with a changing room person) so we didn't get Pants. Nobody really felt strongly about buying any Shirts so we didn't get Shirts. But I wanted to get a Towel so we got a Towel. We had a moment where dad looked at me expecting to go pay and it was a Person checkout bro im not going to go there idk any relevant language. so then we had a little Tussle where i was 'no bro its ok i know u want me to pay and its cringe that i dont want to pay so we dont have to get the towel bro. ill put it back' and Dad was 'fine bro ur cringe its ok ill get it'. or at least it seemed like that.

We then went to a night market and walked around and went to some place serving various Oyster dishes. we ate Oyster dishes. i saw someone get a Beer and i suddenly wanted a Beer and asked dad Can I Get A Beer and dad said umm no and then i said ok and kept eating and then dad asked how is food and i said Good. It Would Taste Great With A Beer. and dad said sth like can u drink bro. will u collapse. or so. and i said im fine bro and so he requested a beer and gave it to me thanks dad!. This was i think literally first time i had ingested Alcohol in front of any of my Parents so it was a bit awkward, but the beer was an uninspiring Lager taste. but did kind of go well with meal.

<div class=aside>
### aside: alcohol is cringe

after dad got me this first beer it was kind of an awkward situation because i think Dad is actually a Fan of Alcohol, while Mother is an Anti of Alcohol. so Dad Likes alcohol but cannot Openly Like it without being kind of Ashamed because Mother constantly says Bro Thats Cringe.

However if u like something and then u find out that ur close relative also likes it, would you not be sort of happy? Except you know deep down that it is a Cringe thing that is Self-Destructive and that it would be better to Not Like it.

This was what Dad seemed like when after i Ate that Beer. Sort of like Enabling me Sure Bro Have Alcohol because I Like Alcohol And Its All Chill Bro while also being aware that It is Bad for you and its Cringe. It was also awkward that Uncle is sort of an Anti and occasionally said 'umm idk if u wanna Enable Drinking Alcohol bro'
</div>

## taiwan day 3 -- taipei

followed UF around some sort of Electronics retailers and department store. for lunch ate 'western' food , steak on pasta , pizza. for dinner ate at a littleish restaurant decided on while walking around in street.

do u remember what i just wrote about in the above Aside? This night i went with Father to grocery store, and while it was probably mainly to get Fruit, Dad allowed me put various Beer and some kind of Deer-Antler Alcohol and some Snacks into the basket. Also they went over to the Liquor counter because they wanted to check the price of some whiskey that they said their friend wanted or sth and was cheaper in Not-USA.

In the night i drank alcohol and ate snacks and clicked through TV channels. Uncle sat next to me and tbh im surprised they didnt say anything about me changing the channel about every 15 seconds. though when i looked over at some point they seemed to be sleeping in a sitting position.

<div class=aside>
### aside: alcohol reviews

As for the alcohol i drank, i really don't remember which i drank on what day. I just remember that, across all Alcohol i drank across all days in Taiwan,

- I had a 'Taiwan' wheatbeer that was pretty good, i like wheat beers.
- One 'Taiwan draft'? lager was pretty good
- the Deer Antler alcohol was .. interesting. apparently is related to some kind of medicinal alcohols. it did taste along the lines of medicine idk if i was supposed to be drinking it like a drink.

i would like to repeat that alchol is cringe and the fact that i am "reviewing" alcohol is cringe as well. if you drink alcohol and are feeling offended "bro i drink alcohol am i cringe too??", yes you are cringe. self-destruction is not cool in any sense. idc whatever stupid Romance has been built up around Alcohol; it is cringe.

actually i am building even more romance around Alcohol by writing about it in my travels. that is kind of cringe ngl. i feel like my father rn.
</div>

## taiwan day 4 -- not taipei

today went with UF to Taizhong City as they went to meet some old Neighbors. Neighbors came drove a Car picked us up and drove us to Somewhere, idk where. they talked and then walked around places. Then we all went to a Hotpot restaurant via Car. Some Neighbor's Relatives (i think) arrived. Two were slightly younger than me. They wanted the One Closer to me in age (who was tutored in English?) to Socialize with me and we Sort of did i guess. Also my dad told me "hey bro they have beer over there" ok bro even though i have consumed ethanol on like 12 of the last 13 days i am not about to Drink Alcohol in front of Two Young Folk And Their Family That I Have Literally Just Met While Nobody Else Is Doing The Same. though honestly it probably Would have been much more comfortable to take Depressants than to Not. BUT life is not about what is comfortable is it!??.🙂

Eventually we were driven back to Train station where took train to [新竹](hsinchu). Where we got off. and UF said hmm well actually we tired and this train station is in the middle of kind of nowhere theres no like connection the city or sth? so we just went back to Taipei.

for dinner i ate leftover rice ball roll and a beer. i dont think dad or uncle ate dinner..? maybe bc hotpot was all-you-can-eat and they ate a lot.

## taiwan day 5 -- taipei
today UF and i went to a family banquet, i.e. lots of relatives gathered at some hotel eat expensive food. there were two other people that looked to be somewhat around my age; one of them was the Relative from Day 1 Dinner.

First, i stood around saying nothing. Then, i sat at the table saying nothing. There was Wine and i drank the Wine happily to Depress my CNS. I socialised a small bit with Day-1 Friend. We even went to the bathroom together once after i asked them "bathroom" and they got up and asked where the bathroom was. epic!.

After the banquet, Many of the relatives went to Apartment and talked and stuff. About the whole day.

## taiwan day 6  -- not taipei
today had a Bus tour booked. went on the Bus tour. One interesting thing was: Dad had a sticker stuck to Shoe, and i didnt say anything since i figured it would probably fall off soon or something (now that i think abt it i think it would be better to just put it in a Trash receptacle so idk why i didnt just say something. maybe i was just used to not saying anything). But someone walking behind us said "hey bro u have sticker on ur shoe" and dad said "oh thx bro lol blah blah blah idk" and then they socialised or sth and then they had a Wife and Child and kept bumping into during tour (bc we were on same tour) and said bye bye when tour was over and stuff. Tbh that was maybe the most memorable part of the Tour.

Another memorable Part was there was this Activity where you Write Things on a Lantern and then Let It Float Away. i was maybe slightly Anticipating this because i was enthusiastic about Calligraphy. however my writing was terrible and i became disillusioned and also didnt know what else to write. so i wrote '[我要回家](i want to go home)' as real silly, a real hehe joke or sth (or maybe just bc it was like the only other phrase i remembered how to write) and dad said "bro what, lol" and i realised i was Cringe and said "lol" and then lined it out, to which my dad said "bro wtf dont do that" and i assumed/interpreted i had just commited a grave Cultural No-No so that was awkward and thus memorable.

The other parts of the Tour was ok, we saw some rocks, and a waterfall, and sat in bus a lot where i mostly drifted in and out of sleep bc most of Taiwan trip i kept waking up Early to UF noises cant go back to sleep.

Lunch we had some little Snacks, little Bites on the Tour and that was basically it iirc. Dinner we went to eat Dinner with a Relative that Dad had forgotten to give some Stuff to. Probably most memorable part of Dinner was that they ordered Bamboo Shoot that came served with Mayonnaise, and then UF started talking about Oh Bro youve never had this before right. And um no i dont think i had haved bamboo shoot cooked like that i think? though i have had bamboo shoot before? so idrk i didnt really say much, and then UF start explaining what Mayonnaise is as if it was some exotic Sauce or sth (ig it is if you look at it close enough).

<div class=aside>
### aside: the urge to Explain and to Know

my Dad and often Uncle loved to Explain things to me. This is nice sometimes, I guess. But they *really* liked explaining things, and they didn't really care to check if I already knew the things they were explaining. Here is an example conversation that i recorded in my notes.

> **Dad:** do u know what taizhong<sup>(台中)</sup> means
>
> **Me:** Taiwan middle?
>
> **Dad:** middle of taiwan because its the middle of taiwan

here is sort of another example

> **older relative to me:** (something in mandarin greeting me goodbye); [再](zai)[回](hui)a
>
> **me:** (hmm did they say '再回a'? does that mean 'come back again'? what else did they say? hmm? how do i greet them goodbye? do i nod? wave? wave. nod. idk)
>
> **dad or uncle (translating for me):** come again
>
> **me:** (oh ok so it Did must have been 再回a which meant come again.)
>
> **dad or uncle:** What did you think they said? Guess.
>
> **me:** (??? bro you just said the translation? what do you expect me to say?? if i say "come again" are you going to question me saying "bro did u just say that because i literally translated it for you?")
>
> **me:** idk
>
> **uncle:** maybe you should start learning chinese

anyways being with my Uncle and Father often just felt like being a Sixth Grader among Sixth Graders competing who Knew the Most. like when we were riding trains sometimes Dad would wonder "hmm where do we need to go?" and than uncle would say "Its probably this" and then dad would be like "hmm idk" and then we walk for a bit and then uncle would see some sign that proved that they were right and they would just Point to it and triumphantly pose like "haha see bro i was right lol".

Also one time we were walking through Electronics Shop and i pointed to some Anker (electronics brand) display and asked Dad if Anker was a Taiwanese company, and he responded Yes. and then shortly after i asked if Logitech was also a Taiwan brand. and then he responded with sth like "yeah bro all these brands are Taiwanese, most of them started by my Classmates<sup>(father went to some technology university in Taiwan)</sup> xd. we here to buy Electronics bc its cheaper to buy Taiwanese electronics in Taiwan". Later randomly i decided to look up and confirm that they were actually Taiwanese companies; Anker is a (mainland) Chinese company and Logitech is a Swiss company, lmao.

end of rant haha :)
</div>

## taiwan day 7 -- taipei

this day i woke up at 6am when dad and uncle was leaving to catch their flight back to usa. iirc i felt tired or sth but couldnt go back to sleep again. i packed my backpack , cleaned up , and ate some [convenience](store) food that i got father to purchase me yesterday thx dad:).

![9.12 08:26 GMT+8: food](pics/20230912_082620.jpg)

![9.12 08:00 GMT+8: contents of my bag i packed for South Korea.](pics/20230912_080002.jpg)

for reference the bag i packed for South Korea contained (in picture from Left to Right, Bottom to Down approx)

- Coin purse
- Antihistamine oral tablets
- 2 masks
- Albuterol inhaler
- USD money
- Portable SSD and cables
- Picture of Duck and USA Covid vaccination card
- 5 pairs of T-Shirts and Underpants
- Epinephrine injector
- Gacha capsule containing little souvenier I planned to give to Sister
- Charging cable in nifty charging-cable retainer i bought in Japan (USB-C to USB-C)
- Charging cable in nifty charging-cable retainer i bought in Japan (USB-A to Lightning)
- Passport
- Floss picks
- Nail clipper and ear swabs in Altoids (candy) tin
- Wired earphones with USB-C to 3.55mm convertor
- Little SIM tool thing
- Towel
- USB-C charging thing
- Wireless earphones
- Wallet
- Umbrella
- Disposable razor I got from some hotel
- Socks
- (Not in picture) plastic teeth retainer
- (Not in picture) toothbrush and little toothpaste in plastic case

This is about the same haul I brought to Japan, except I no longer had Laptop or Handkerchief (i gave them to dad to carry home. thanks dad!), my charging cables were in neat Retainer box things, and I now had an Umbrella and Coin purse.

Looking back, i never used the SSD or Picture-of-duck-with-vaccination-card and would not bring on another trip if i go on one. I would also maybe only bring One mask just in Very case; could always just More if needed at convenience store. In my entire travels I only used a mask Once, and that situation was avoidable (going into library in Japan which had a sign saying to put on mask).

After eating and packing i took a little nap i think until it was time to check out of the AIRBNB. i checked out of the AIRBNB and then went to wander around Taipei City. i knew approximately Zero about Taiwan unfortunately. so i looked up "japantown" i dont think i found anything. i looked up "koreatown" and found some Street that was supposed to be some kind of korea someting. so i took train there, and tbh the most Korean thing i remember seeing was a poster advertising Tourism to the city of [대구](daygoo).

![9.12 11:50 GMT+8:: poster advertising tourism to daygoo. btw i checked the prices and flying from taipei to daygoo is about the same or even sometimes slightly cheaper than flying from taipei to Seoul, which is kind of wild considering seoul is Seoul and daygoo is...not Seoul?.](pics/20230912_115041.jpg)

![9.12 12:10 GMT+8: i also saw this helpful infographic of Banana.](pics/20230912_121015.jpg)

![9.12 12:10 GMT+8: i also saw this neat-looking vandalism.](pics/20230912_121052.jpg)

but anyways i just walked around and looked at things. i walked through a neat marketplace thing there were lots of people.

![9.12 12:12 GMT+8: market](pics/20230912_121206.jpg)

![9.12 12:13 GMT+8: market 2. i felt awkward taking these pictures.](pics/20230912_121339.jpg)

![9.12 12:42 GMT+8: pizza hut](pics/20230912_124234.jpg)

![9.12 12:47 GMT+8: roads. there were a lot of autobikes in taipei.](pics/20230912_124754.jpg)

![9.12 12:50 GMT+8: some street](pics/20230912_125007.jpg)

i walked to a park, it was nice probably. there was a pigeon loafing right smack in the middle of the sidewalk, idk why. they loafed there from when i arrived to when i left. there was a human sitting across from them on a bench.

![9.12 13:08 GMT+8: loaf](pics/20230912_130823.jpg)

there was a library in the park; i went into the library and sat at a desk for a bit and looked at phone and enjoyed sitting and used bathroom and things. Then i left the library.

![9.12 14:41 GMT+8: after leaving library i came across this vending machine (also in park). vending machines in Taiwan are very rare btw i think i only saw maybe One other vending machine. it was interesting. they didnt localise the Japanese 'つめた～い'??. I was going to try to purchase drink the "asparagus juice" (which is only 10% actual asparagus juice???), but as i was pulling out my Coin Purse, someone came over to me and started speaking mandarin(?) to me and i understood basically none of it. I saw them gesturing to prices and payment or something and i thought that maybe they were saying sth like "you cant buy stuff that ends in a 5 bc it doesnt accept NTD5 coins"? or maybe they were saying "you can pay with digital payment"?? i really had no clue. and then they started asking me what i interpreted to be "[你有(???)嗎](do you have (???))". but i had no clue what the (???) was so i just kind of stared at them confused and they kept asking. Until they switched to "[你不知道(???)?](do you not know (???))" or sth, to which i responded by shaking my head and then they said sth like "why dont u know (???)" (but in mandarin) and then they said "English?" and i nodded and they were like "oh ok" or sth. and then they said "good" or sth, and then walked away???? and i walked away. that was confusing i have no clue what happened there.](pics/20230912_144147.jpg)

![9.12 14:45 GMT+8: pigeon](pics/20230912_144557.jpg)

I probably then walked to nearby subway station and rode to Taipei station, where i ate McDonalds. i thought it was Kisok order but then i had to print receipt and then hand to a worker to pay which was slightly anxiety inducing. they said sth i didnt understand but i paid and got my receipt and waited for my order and picked up my order and ate it outside the station which did not feel like the cleanest and best smelling environment but i was hungry didnt really care. i had

- BLT hamburger
- 'chicken mccrispy'
- fries
- orange juice

![9.12 16:14 GMT+8: orange juice](pics/20230912_161441.jpg)

![9.12 16:15 GMT+8: mccrispy = fried chicken](pics/20230912_161533.jpg)

![9.12 16:18 GMT+8: BLT burger](pics/20230912_161758.jpg)

it was nice. then i took train to airport bc i didnt really feel like doing anything else. but  i arrived too early it was 5:40pm or so and they didnt let people check in until 7:25pm. So i just sat around the airport charging phone and so, occasionally going outside and sitting in the smoking area because that was the only comfortable place to sit outside (i went outside bc i was cold inside).

eventually , i checked in . went through airport security . waited at my gate. to board the plane i had to get on a Bus and then the Bus drove to the Plane and everyone got off the Bus and walked up Steps to the Plane which was interesting, i dont think ive ever had that kind of boarding.

![9.12 20:04 GMT+8: i am semi-allergic to milk but accidentally bought this Milk Tea bc idk what the chinese said (i now see that there is an itty bitty 乳 in there which suggests that it is milk tea) and i had no clue what "Au Lait" meant. And i assumed that since the bottom label said "oolong tea" it would be oolong tea. however it was milk tea. oops!.](pics/20230912_200417.jpg)
