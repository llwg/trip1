Korea</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Plane arrive in south korea at around 1AM local time. I walk in the
airport , i want to sleep. i wonder if there is some sleeping area. Idk.
but i went through Immigration and Custom by Filling Out a physical
paper. i dont remember what i put for my intended address i probably
just googled some hotel and wrote down its address.</p>
<p>then i was in the Airport. i walked around wondering if there was a
place to sleep but there seemed to not be. however i bought a SIM card
at the convenience store by first Lurking around the convenience store
planning what i was going to say or gathering energy or sth and then
went up to the clerk and saying “can i get a blue one 7 days” or sth in
english and they said ok checked me out.</p>
<p>went over to some benches and lied down on the benches bc i saw other
ppl doing that also so i assumed it was OK. i used my backpack as a
pillow and one of my (clean) socks as an eye mask. and try to sleep
some. I ended up sleeping at least a few hours with occasional waking up
in-between.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">9.13 03:07 GMT+9: ceiling of ICN at 3am
KST</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>some time morning i woke up and decided i had had enough sleep, also
it was bright and ppl were moving around so i doubt i could go back to
sleep. i probably washed face in bathroom sink or so; the bathrooms were
nice. I went to a currency exchange within the airport and then walked
up to them not exactly sure what to do and handed them some USD dollars
and then they asked sth like “won?” and i said “yes” probably and they
converted and gave me the KRW money.</p>
<p>i walked downstairs to the trains area where they had vending
machines that sold transportation IC cards. very convenient!. however
the machines said they only accepted up to
<ruby>KRW10000<rt>MANWON</rt></ruby> bills and i only had
<ruby>KRW50000<rt>OH MAN, won</rt></ruby> bills. so i went over to some
Money area and clicked around an ATM to see if there were any tools
there; there were none to my knowledge. so then i went to the Currency
Excange and then said something along the lines of
“…<ruby>MANWON<rt>KRW10000</rt></ruby>..?….(<ruby>으로<rt>into</rt></ruby>??)”
and then the person thought a bit and then said sth like “usually not
allowed to…” (in korean) and then took my two KRW50000 bills and then
did some conversion saying (in english) “usually im not supposed to do
this but something something i forget what exactly they said” and handed
me it in KRW10000 bills, and i said thank u and left. thank you currency
exchange person!</p>
<p>then i bought a transportation card , the cuter one that cost KRW1000
extra, and then used machine put KRW10000 on it , then went to ride the
Train towards Seoul.</p>
<p>tbh i don’t remember where i got off the train. i remember not
knowing where i wanted to go so randomly getting off at wherever seemed
right, looking at signs and going wherever seemed cool, or where large
crowds of people seemed to be going (at some point i decided i wanted to
go to <ruby>용산<rt>yongsan</rt></ruby> bc name sounded neat even though
i dont think ive ever heard of the place before).</p>
<p>But at some point i got off the train and exited the station and then
walked around. somehow i came across <ruby>홍익 대학교<rt>hongik
university</rt></ruby> which i had roughly heard of before, so i walked
around the campus a bit and left. the most i remember about the campus
is that there were large handwritten posters about i think japan dumping
nuclear waste into the sea, and also some people seemed to be preparing
for a Festival.</p>
<p>then, i went to subway station and then rode subway to Anywhere
again, which i decided to be <ruby>동대문<rt>east big door</rt></ruby>.
idk why <ruby>동대문<rt>dong day moon</rt></ruby>; i think i heard of it
somewhere maybe in my Korean Class Textbook or sth. I was at some
transfer station looking at the Map and wondering Which of the two
line-1 platform went towards <ruby>동대문<rt>DONG DAY MOON</rt></ruby>
when some guy walked up to me and said (in english) “where are u going”
and i pointed to the map 동대문 and and they said “line 1” and pointed
at the line 1 entrance and i said thx and they left. that was chill of
them even though they didnt tell me which platform to take which was my
actual concern.</p>
<p>i got out of the <ruby>동대문역<rt>dong day moon station</rt></ruby>
and then i saw same neat big building thing while walking across like
eight lanes of traffic or sth and then i just walked around along roads.
i decided to visit a Store to potentially Purchase Things. so i looked
up where is “e-mart” on the internet and then walked to that E-mart. why
e-mart? idk i think i heard of it before so i assumed it was big and
Corporate Chain vibes which i knew i would feel more comfortable
shopping than small random stores i could find by walking streets.</p>

<p>So i walked there and browsed the emart. i ended up buying a Charger
(south korean outlets are different shape than japan, taiwan, usa) after
staring at all the diff options for like 30 mins or sth.</p>
<p>i then left, planning to take a walk in the rain to McDonalds.
however on my walk over, i remembered that Seoul has this large river
running through it called the <ruby>한강<rt>han river</rt></ruby> that
you can sit along it and enjoy it or sth. So i took a detour to a subway
station and rode to a nearby area that had access to the River, which i
decided to be <ruby>잠실<rt>JAM SHIL</rt></ruby>.</p>
<p>I got off at <ruby>잠실역<rt>JAMSIL STATION</rt></ruby> and then
crossed <del>eight</del> twelve?fourteen? or so lanes of traffic (With
crosswalk) to go to a mcdonalds where i ordered some Food and then
headed to the River.</p>
<section id="k-carculture" class="aside">
<h3>K-carculture</h3>
<p>i kind of expected it but one thing i noticed when first looking
around Seoul is that the streets and roads are gigantic and there are
cars everywhere. also crosswalks are often not in the most intuitave
places so sometimes to cross the road i had to walk in the opposite
direction of where i want to end up to get to a crosswalk, wait for the
crosswalk, cross the crosswalk, and then walk back in the direction i
was going to go.</p>

</figure>
<p>I arrived at the River. i wanted to purchase maybe Instant noodles
and Alcohol to eat with my Mcdonalds, so i went to Convenience store.
unfortunately everything seemed overpriced so i exited the convenience
and walked to a Different convenience store. however the First
convenience i went to was ‘GS25<ruby>한강잠실1호점<rt>HAN RIVER JAMSIL
STORE NO.1</rt></ruby>’ and This convenience was
‘GS25<ruby>한강잠실2호점<rt>HAN RIVER JAMSIL STORE NO.2</rt></ruby>’ so
i doubted prices were going to be any different, and indeed they were
Not. So i just There bought an bottle of Soju and an can of CHILSUNG
CIDER (KRW5000 and KRW2000 respectively, i think). the checkout i felt
chill and nonintimidated. i think they asked me if i needed a bag which
i negative bodylanguaged and do u want a cup which i affirmatively
bodylanguaged.</p>
<p>I then carried all my stuff to a little stairs/sitting? area that
looked out to the River. it was still raining so to try to mitigate
Wetness i put down my Plastic bag to Sit on and then used umbrella to
sort of kind of cover my Backpack and Food.</p>

<p>Check-in was Chill , i showed up and then i think i might have said
something unintelligible and then they said something like “are you
James hfudjfjne?” (but in korean i think), and i said yes and they held
up bag of toiletries or sth and said this is KRW1000 and i said no thx
(nonverbally) and they handed me my keycard. and then they also asked me
if they got the pronunciation of my name right which was chill of
them.</p>
<p>The room was alright i think , it was clean enough though some random
Hairs in random places which was a bit 🤔 , and it probably had some
sort of faint cigarette smell (literally all motels i stayed in had some
degree of Cigarette smell). It cost USD30.13 which .. was not exactly
cheap. but oh well. One nice thing is that it came with two Juice boxes
in the fridge (one Orange and one Apple), and i think also bottled
water(s). this was nice. i drank them happily.</p>

<h2 id="korea-day-2-seoul-suwon">korea day 2 – seoul, suwon</h2>
<p>This day i woke up. Or more specifically, i woke up at 8AM via an
alarm I set, then set another alarm for 9AM and then slept or remained
half-conscious in bed until 9AM. Then i gathered my things and stuff and
then checked out. Btw usually when i made bookings before they provided
me with a Time i had to check-out by, but this motel had no ‘check-out
time’ listed so idk when i actually had to leave.</p>

<p>I went to train station where i sat down and used phone wondering
where I should go. I remembered that the South Korean Global Pop
Sensation “NewJeans” was planning to make performances around That Date,
so i looked it up, and it turns out they was going to perform at
<ruby>성균관대학교<rt>SUNG KYUN KWAN UNIVERSITY</rt></ruby> That Day.
That seemed Interesting, though i didnt know if i could just Walk in or
sth or idk. However i figured out i could just figure it out as i went;
i still had a few Hours before the festival Probably Started.</p>
<p>So, i Went to the <ruby>성균관대학교<rt>SUNG KYUN KWAN
UNIVERSITY</rt></ruby> campus at seoul, but getting off at
<ruby>경복궁<rt>GYEONGBOK PALACE</rt></ruby> station to take a look at
<ruby>경복궁<rt>GYONGBOK PALACE</rt></ruby>. i took a little peek but
tbh mostly just saw a gigantic gravel lot so i tried to find myself out
of the area but got slightly confused, eventually deciding i needed to
use the restroom and going into the <ruby>국립고궁박물관<rt>national
palace museum</rt></ruby>, which i discovered had free admission so i
walked around There which was cool.</p>

<p>then i exited and then walked north and east towards
<ruby>성균관대<rt>SKKU</rt></ruby> , and on the way i checked my mobile
phone to see that a Friend that i had informed about my Plans said that
the Festival was being held at the Campus not in Seoul but in
<ruby>수원<rt>SOO WON</rt></ruby>. oops! So, i rerouted Strolled Over to
the nearest Train Station.</p>

<p>then, i took the train to <ruby>성균관대<rt>SKKU</rt></ruby> Soowon
campus. according to my calculations this probably only actually took
like 1 hour which was nice. I then stood in the
<ruby>외부인<rt>outsider</rt></ruby> line to gain entrance which was the
longest queue i have ever stood in in my life i think. It went up a hill
down a hill around a building and then into a sports field. i arrived i
think 30 mins ‘early’ btw.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/미친줄.webp"
alt="at its height, i believe the line looked sth like this. i entered the queue around where the yellow marker is placed. According to My Calculations, once the line started moving it took about 45 mins to reach the front." />

</figure>
<p>eventually i reached front of line. i needed to show an ID and i
wondered hmm dang would my passport suffice so i walked up and then
tried to say the words <ruby>역권<rt>passport</rt></ruby> to the guy and
then they said to me (in english) “i dont speak korean. show me ur id”.
so i handed them my passport and it worked. admission was KRW15000 btw
iirc.</p>
<p>I then stood in the shorter and faster moving Entry line. they
checked bags so i opened my bag which contained my entire trips worth of
Things , i remember i put my Bag of Stuff Stored In A Large Ziploc Bag
on the table and one of the persons was like “whats this” to the other
person and the other person replied “idk its this guy’s”. and then they
let me through.</p>
<p>I walked around a bit observing the environment. i thought about
getting food bc i had not eaten that day except for orange juice box i
drank in morning and little sips of water bottle that i had to get rid
of at the entrance. But all the food trucks looked scary (talk to
person) and also expensive, so i did not. i also tried to look for
bathroom but from what i overheard u had to exit the Area, use bathroom
somewhere else, and stand in entry line to reenter (go through bag check
again). so i wasnt gonna do that i just wandered back over to the People
Pit and stood there, thinking that maybe if I stood there long enough i
could get somewhat closer to the Stage.</p>
<p>I stood there for about three hours and really didnt get any
noticeably closer to the stage , except when one Artist came up and
everyone took several Steps Forward. oops!. There were performances from
various Artists, School-Affiliated organizations. Also at one point the
MC nim did their own performance which was cool and chill.</p>

i thought by not eating maybe it would feel more like a spiritual
experience, however unfortunately or fortunately i felt soberingly
Normal.</p>

<p>it was cool though most of the time i could just barely see things if
the tall people aligned the gaps between their heads in the right way.
Eventually , performance came to an End. also there was no Encore stage
because the event organisers say they running out of time and started
cutting artist’s Encore Stages. However, once The South Korean Global
Pop Sensation NewJeans finished their performance and left stage, large
amount of people started Leaving, and MC nim said hmm guys dont do that
theres still lots of cool performance n artist please dont do that thats
not nice. but people kept leaving and then MC nim said ok bro thats not
chill we have newjeans encore stage for ppl that didnt leave. and then
The South Korean Global Pop Sensation NewJeans came back on stage and
held an encore stage.</p>

<p>Following this , there were a bunch of performances by 성균관대 like
umm im not sure i think a student organisation ?. a few times they
performed like school spirit songs and stuff which ur supposed to join
shoulders and move back and forth in a school spirit which was kind of
awkward im not even from the school .</p>

<p>eventually even though i planned stay to the last scheduled Artist
which i sort of kind of had heard of before , i realised that it was
actually going to be a lot later than i thought so i made myself out of
the large crowd of people to exit the Festival. funnily enough , outside
of the crowd the view of the stage was kind of.. better? and less
obscured by people, even though it was farther away.</p>
<p>I walked out the festival and across the street to some kind of
commercial district.</p>

<p>i thought for a bit about just going into a Restaurants which i was
scared to go in bc i dont wanna order. However i didnt, and i saw a
<ruby>convenience<rt>store</rt></ruby>, which i entered and bought some
food to eat. Checkout i remember was slightly awkward bc i said i didnt
need bag but there was kind of a lot of stuff so i had to stack the
stuff strategically to carry it away and the clerk kinda tried to help
me i think, pick something up “how should i give this to u” um but i
managed, even though i dropped something on the floor.</p>
<p>i carried all my stuff to the little eating counter and then warmed
the stuff up and then ate it. While eating i probably used my phone and
reserved my Lodging for the night.</p>

<p>Eventually i finished and left and took train to my Lodging. when i
was checking in i think there was some confusion , and i wondered if it
was bc i made the reservation just a few hours before . so i was
thinking hmm should i try to say ‘i reserved it shortly before’ (but in
korean)?? but then i just stood there in silence until idk what happened
but they gave me a key or so.</p>
<p>I do not remember anything particularly good or bad about this motel.
Here is what i wrote about it in my Notes in the Evening tomorrow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it wasnt fantastic but like bedsheets looked and felt clean and
towels didnt smell and nothing was noticeably filthy. u had like some
wallpaper peeling or sth and like tape over stuff and just little bits
that made u think hmm but for my purposes of washing ond (sic) sleeping
was good esp for usd 19. though idk why there wasnt room slippers so i
just used bathroom slippers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i probably showered, brushed teeth etc. and went to sleep. END OF DAY

<p>i didn’t really know what to do. but i decided to take a bus to the
sort-of-nearby 성남시, because an friend said they was from that Area
and could recommend food to eat there. I sat at an Bus stop for a bit
before realising that i probably needed to wait at the bus stop on the
Other Side of the street, not this one. so i went to cross the street,
and while i was waiting at the crosswalk i saw the Bus i needed to Take
pull up and leave the bus stop. oops!. i crossed the street and took the
next one, which i dont remember being too long but i dont remember
tbh.</p>

<h3>aside: riding (normal) bus (in south korea)</h3>
<p>in south korea i rode the Buses in many different places, and for all
of them (except the ones where u buy a ticket at a station) they work
like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>wait at station</li>
<li>bus arrive</li>
<li>step on bus. at entrance there is place for u to scan ur
IC/transportation card. u can hover (or touch if ur really into it) your
card at that place and it will <ruby>BBI<rt>삐</rt></ruby> sound which
means u successfully registered ur Entry.
<ul>
<li>occasionally it will say “<ruby>카드를 한장만 대주세요<rt>KADURUR
HANJANGMAN DEJUSAY YO</rt></ruby>” which means u gotta scan ur card
again bc it messed up</li>
</ul></li>
<li>request stop where u want to get off by pressing request stop
button/cord right before the stop u want to get off</li>
<li>bus stops at ur stop. the back exit door thing exits. scan ur card
again at the reader near the door in order to register your Exitry.</li>
<li>get off the bus</li>
<li>congratulations! you have ridden the Bus now.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>the bus ride was cool and chill and took about an hour. i figured out
while on the bus or so that i could have taken the train which i
personally probably would have maybe preferred. though actually bus was
maybe actually more comfortable because u have large comfy seats versus
train often there are no seats u gotta stand.</p>
<p>Eventually i got off the Bus in <ruby>성남시<rt>SEONG NAM
CITY</rt></ruby>, and i planned to go to restaurant recommended by
Friend. so i took the Subway and Walked there.</p>

<h3>Aside: south-korean (subway) public restrooms</h3>
<p>i visited many south-korean public restrooms, mostly (92%?) at subway
stations. here is what i came to expect from them:</p>
<ul>
<li>cleanliness: not filthy but not pristine</li>
<li>sinks: except at maybe the Airport, every sink i used was Manual,
i.e. you physically touch something to turn the water off and on.</li>
<li>soap: i would say most? bathrooms (at least in subway/bus stations)
had some form of handsoap to use. however, not all did. the most common
form of soap was BARSOAP, often mounted on a metal rod. liquid soap
dispensers were uncommon (but not rare).</li>
<li>paper towels: excluding the airport, i dont think any public
restroom i visited had paper towels. maybe one?</li>

<p>I arrived at the Restaurant. I felt scared but after loitering a bit
i Just Went In. The persons asked me how many people i was, to which i
replied by holding up One Finger. and then they said hmm we dont got
Single Person Seats so can u wait outside and we call u when we got the
seat. so i went out shooken in my (figurative)boots and sat in the
little waiting area. and looked at my phone.</p>
<section id="aside-rain-and-crocs-and-socks" class="aside">
<h3>aside: rain and crocs and socks</h3>
<p>lots of days i was in south korea it rained a lot. i wore crocs.
usually i wear socks inside my crocs. however when its raining ur socks
become wet and squishy. so i just wore crocs and bare feet. i hope you
feel informed after knowing this information.</p>
</section>
<p>Eventually someone told me to come in. they sat me at my seat and
stuff and i got a kettle of tea and menu or sth. and then i looked at
the menu and thought (maybe) and then i ordered, i think i did so by</p>
<ul>
<li>looking up around the restaurant until sort of making eye contact
with waiter</li>
<li>holding up hand or so and they went over to me and i sort of held
the menu in a manner that suggested i was about to order</li>
<li>saying , iirc , “<ruby>짜장면 하나<rt>one BLACK BEAN
NOODLES</rt></ruby>, (pointing to ‘자장면’ on the menu), (FLIP THE PAGE
OF MENU), <ruby>이거<rt>this</rt></ruby> (points to

<li>the waiter said “ok XXXX and XXXX?” or sth and i affirmed and they
took menu and left.</li>
<li>the ordering process was finished</li>
</ul>
<p>i sat there shooked out of my (figurative) boots, out of my wits,
Very Scared so to speak. even though i had heard and gone through head
various times what approx what Social Script to follow when visiting
South-Korean restaurant, i was still very Unfamiliar and Scared. over
next minutes , i was broughten my Order. first the Meat dish, then the
Noodles dish.</p>

<p>Eventually i was full but still had Meat left , so , i attempted to
ASK CAN U WRAP THIS FOR ME SO I CAN TAKE IT AWAY. to do this i utilised
the technique i called ‘speaking real slow and drawn out so u have to
only say like 2 words and the person will interpret the rest of what u
mean’. so i said something like ‘<ruby>이거<rt>this</rt></ruby>
<ruby>포장<rt>packaging</rt></ruby>…’ except more like
‘<ruby>I<rt>이</rt></ruby> <ruby>Go<rt>거</rt></ruby>
<ruby>Po<rt>포</rt></ruby>
<ruby>Zaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<rt>자ㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏ</rt></ruby>’
to which they responded sth like ‘<ruby>포장해드릴까요<rt>i wrap for
u?</rt></ruby>’ which i affirmed, likely nonverbally.</p>
<p>And so i got my meat packaged and i was ready to Leave. From my
observations during eating, i believed that you payed at the counter. So
i took out prepared my Cash and went up to the counter and they probably
asked me ‘u gonna pay now?’ before i needed to say anything which i
could affirm nonverbally. and i hand my payment and they ask me
something like do i need Some kind of receipt or sth???? idk i just
heard receipt so i affirmed, but then they asked me to enter some kind
of number and i was confused and i looked confused and then they asked
“i just give to u?” or sth and i probably affirmed or sth idk what
happened but anyways i got my change and receipt and left. idk if they
was asking like phone number to send digital receipt or sth to?? not
sure. If u know lmk in the comments section below :).</p>
<section id="aside-how-the-restaurants-keep-track-of-who-ordered-what"
class="aside">
<h3>aside: how the restaurants keep track of who ordered what??</h3>
<p>one thing that still puzzles me idk how it happens is restaurants
that keep track of all the tables Who ordered the things at that table
it is was truly confounding for me. actually it isnt that confounding
but it was still interesting. you just go in and say ur order and they
say ok and give u it and then after u walk up the counter the person at
counter knows who u are what u ate.</p>
</section>
<p>Finally i was out of the restaurant . I felt the need to Leave, so i
built the intention to go to the South-Korean East Coast. I thought to
take a Train. but there appeared to be none trains directly from
<ruby>성남시<rt>seongnam city</rt></ruby> to the East Coast. So i rode
trains back up to Seoul and then looked to take a train to somewhere on
the East Coast. However it looked like all the high-speed trains were
sold out (and i don’t think they had just Normal Trains that go there –
not completely sure about this though?). So i decided to take a Bus.</p>
<p>i went to a Bus Terminal i found by googling bus directions to east
coast on naver map. i was very confused for a few mins because i thought
the Place Where You Ride Taxis in front of the Terminal Building was the
Bus Stop. it was actually the big Building behind it.</p>

<p>in the Bus Terminal there was some ticket vending machines u can just
navigate its touch screen application thing to purchase a ticket. i used
it to purchase a ticket to <ruby>동해<rt>dong hae</rt></ruby> with a
Credit Card. very convenient!.</p>
<p>then i had a few tens of minutes before bus departure so i browsed
bought some things at a convenience store in the station. and ate them.
and used bathroom. and then boarded the bus. the bus had a neat thing
where u could just scan ur boarding pass ticket. very neat!.</p>

<p>The plastic box the restaurant put my Meat in was very high-quality,
like it felt thicker and sturdier than some of the name-brand plastic
containers u can buy at USA mart. so i washed it in the sink to use to
store some of my Belongings. I also washed my Plastic Bag That I Sat On
At The <ruby>한강<rt>HAN RIVER</rt></ruby>, because it had gotten wet in
the Rain on DAY1, i put it in my backpack, and then forgot to take it
out at night , so it developed very not-nice smell.</p>
<p>Then i went to sleep (after shower, brush teeth) probably. End of DAY
3</p>

<p>i walked and walked without much plan except to walk south. i didnt
really know where i was going to sleep. i sort of planned : i should
sleep on the beach. in fact before i came to south korea i thought of
the idea ‘what if i slept on the beach or something’. however i wasnt
sure if i should really do that. However as it grew darker and darker it
seemed like the best option probably Was to just sleep on beach
somewhere.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it was a bit rain , so i thought i should go to a
convenience store and buy maybe like a tarp(?) or rain ponchos ? or so.
so i walked to the nearest (south) one, but it seemed to be located in
some kind of resort building which i was not about to Go Into. So i
decided to walk West into town or so to go to one. But when i tried to
walk West i ran into these giant..nets??? that blocked my way. idk why
the nets were there. So i turned around and went into the Resort. The
convenience store was in the Basement and it was the saddest convenience
store i seen; the food-prep station was out of order , half of the
shelves were empty and stuff . and i dont think they had any ponchos or
whatever. So i left. and kept walking south.</p>

<p>Eventually i reached , the next closest southern convenience stores.
there were quite many People in this area, im guessing taking a trip. i
went into a Seven-Eleven and bought some food. i ate some at the inside
food table but i was opening some Alcohol when clerk said cant drink
that in here so i went outside and finished meal sitting on beach
shortly outside the store.</p>

<section id="aside-나무젓가락" class="aside">
<h3>aside: 나무젓가락</h3>
<p>I remember this episode when seeing the phrase
‘<ruby>나무젓가락<rt>wooden chop sticks</rt></ruby>’ i wrote in
notes:</p>
<p>in the Seven Eleven i was sat down to eat , i realised i dont have
any utensil. so i looked around i dont see any chopsticks. dam i gotta
go to the register ask!??!?!?, so i went up to the register kinda look
like im looking for something , and then one of the workers just asked
approx ‘<ruby>나무젓가락 하나 드릴까요??<rt>u need wooden
chopsticks??</rt></ruby>’ , to which i could nonverbally affirm. And so
i got my Utensils without even needing to say a words. fantastic!.</p>

<p>eventually i finished eating and strolled shortly down the street.
there were people i think car camping and stuff. i walked a bit further
down the street and it was quieter with an area that both had some light
from street lamps but also darkness. i decided this was an okay spot to
Sleep. so i sat and lied in a spot.</p>

<p>it was not really Raining but it was sort of Drizzling. lie on ground
i could occasionally feel like little crabs?i assumed crawl onto me. I
wondered should i instead sleep in gazebo i passed by<sup>(i didnt see
it in the dark but when i re-passed it in the morning i noticed there
was signs saying dont sleep in here)</sup>??. however i decided : i had
thought about sleeping on beach so long , just do it now bro! otherwise
u probably wont ever get to do it later in life maybe.</p>
<p>i was slightly concerned about the Tides what if i wake up all my
stuff is wet??. so i tried to look up the Tides schedule in that area
but i gave up and assumed that i would feel my feet be wet before it got
to my Backpack (which i was lying on as pillow). Also i slept on pretty
high-ground.</p>
<p>I was slightly Cold and shivering because of the drizzle. I drank
some Alcohol imagining that maybe it would warm my body or sth and/or
make me drowsy fall asleep<sup>(even though i usually wake up from
alcohol-induced sleep a few hours later so this probably wasnt a great
plan. but i think i just wanted to sleep Quickly.)</sup>. however i was
still Wet and as a result Cold, and being Wet and Cold did not really
Permit Sleep. I wrote in my notes at 11 minutes past midnight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>im cold and regret my decisions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>END OF DAY 4</p>

<p>I woke up several times during the night/morning. Here are Notes i
took at various times:</p>

<p>i put on two shirts at first felt very warm now im chilly

<blockquote>

<p>i stepped into the sea/ocean waters and they felt strangely warm. i
guess i was cold and moist. according to the weather report i
screenshotted , it was 22 degrees celcius which i would not expect to be
Cold , but even after wearing three total (t-)shirts i was chilly and
shivering after a while.</p>

<p>Eventually it was bright and so i left and walked back to the
seven-eleven i bought dinner at yesterday. i bought a vitamin drink to
make up for sleeping outside (🙂) , and then looked around the Food Prep
area to see if there were any electrical outlets i could charge my phone
(i was at like 15% battery). however i didn’t see any , left , drank my
vitamin drink , went to walk to the bus stop naver maps told me to go
to.</p>

</figure>
<p>sat at bus stop. someone else also arrived and sat at bus stop next
to me. the silence was awkward but i did my best to avoid any eye
contact or conversation because i think that would have been more
awkward.</p>
<p>Eventually bus came and i rode the bus back..up north. The bus
literally drove the same road i had walked (in opposite direction)
yesterday.</p>

<p>i got off (at a slightly incorrect stop iirc) and walked to the Bus
Terminal. i walked into the Bus Terminal and tried to use the digital
ticket machine. but it didnt seem to have tickets to basically anywhere
i wanted so i left the Bus Terminal and wondered if i could take the
train out of here.</p>
<p>So i spent 30 or so minutes walking to a train station which seemed
to be..closed? I was very confused . but aftering using naver maps to
search Train directions out of the area , there were literally no
directions. so i just assumed the train station was closed or sth(lmk if
u know what was up in the comment’s section below :).).</p>

<p>So, i walked back to the Bus Terminal, stopping by a public restroom
on the way (which did not have soap). I noticed that in the toilet stall
there was an electric outlet. So i plugged my charger in and stood there
charging phone for a few minutes bc i was dangerously low on
battery.</p>

<p>At the bus terminal i tried unsuccessfully to use the ticket vending
machine again. then i sat in bench trying to cope with the fact that i
probably have to talk to someone.</p>
<p>I planned to go to <ruby>포항<rt>POHANG</rt></ruby>. and i saw that
there was a bus schedule thing that said there was a 10:40 bus heading
to <ruby>포항<rt>POHANG</rt></ruby>. But the ticket vending machine
Didnt Have Pohang Tickets. was i missing sth? was schedule only on
certain days??</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">9.17 10:15 GMT+9: TIME TABLE</figcaption>

<p>I observed someone go up to the counter and buy a ticket to maybe
<ruby>부산<rt>BUSAN</rt></ruby> or maybe
<ruby>포항<rt>POHANG</rt></ruby> even and i was 🤔🤔 because i think i
had tried to get a ticket to there from the vending machine and it Didnt
Work. and then i saw someone go up to the ticket vending machine,
unsuccessfully use it, then go over to counter and buy a ticket there.
So i interpreted that the vending machine must Just Not Work.</p>
<p>So , eventually , i went up to the counter , the little hole in the
wall . and then said hopefully something like “<ruby>포항은 어떻게
가요<rt>POHANG HOW I GO</rt></ruby>” , to which the person said sth like
“pohang? theres bus at 10:40”. And then i paused and though for (what
felt to me like) an awkwardly long amount of time processing the message
(numbers like ‘10:40’ tooked a long time to process). And then i
realised that yes, that is what i want. and i sort of tried to
communicate that and probably said some nonsensical noises or
nodded(which i doubt they could see bc it was a hole in the wall) or
gestured or idk, and they said ‘<ruby>한 장이요<rt>one
jang</rt></ruby>?’ approx to which i affirmed and they tell me the
amount and i gave them credit card and then they say that no
<ruby>외국카드<rt>foreign card</rt></ruby> so i took out cash but had an
oopsies where i pulled out a KRW5000 bill instead KRW50000 so then
fumbled around in coin purse while they typed the number into a
calculator to show me. Eventually i got my ticket and ride the Bus. the
end.</p>

there. However they were closed (i had failed to notice this when
looking it up). I looked up more food places but most places were
closed, maybe because it was sunday. eventually i decided to go to

walk by. there was no one in there. i was not going to go in There bro.
i walk by again the other way. i think: no ok i am not going to go in
there. and then i had a short mental breakdown/dialogue/debate/idk which
was sort of like “I dont want to go in. But if i dont go in thats stupid
bro. Im hungry. NO I CANT GO IN. bro this is cringe ur whole trip will
just be remember u couldnt go into noodle shop eat noodle eat
convenience food. You will leave this Country Shortly u cant go into any
more noodle shops. Just go into the store. NOOOOOOO i dont want to go
in. anyways i dont really like noodles. nobodys there maybe its not good
anyways. Bro why are you afraid. Im scared. Im scared. I dont want to go
in. I dont need to eat. Im ok. I dont want to go in. Your trip is a
Flop. You will remember this time for the rest of your life.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH”</p>
<p>So eventually while surpressing my conscious thought or so i entered
the noodle shop and person tell me to sit wherever and i looked at menu
(i had already looked at it online and decided). I point at menu that i
want tell them ‘<ruby>이거 하나 주세요<rt>THIS ONE PLEASE</rt></ruby>’
while self-destructing inside and then they Go away and then Come back
with stuff and noodles – according my notes i may have said in either a
very small or inaudible voice ‘<ruby>thank you<rt>but in
korean</rt></ruby>’. I ate my noodles and stuff and then was ready to
pay but then the server was like in and out of the store idk doing what
hanging with they besties so i just wait a while sipping my Tea and then
some time when they hover over i act like i want to
<ruby>계산<rt>payment</rt></ruby> so they take my cash (which was exact
amount) and then walk over to cash register or sth and i hear/see them
put it in the cash register and then idk if im supposed to wait for them
to confirm that i paid right amount or sth…???. i wait a bit and take a
long sip of tea to make sure im not missing something in the social
script and then Leave the shop.</p>

<p>I think Past Me can describe the checkin process better than i can
remember it. Here is what i wrote in Notes about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i took bus to hotel area went to the desk umm i said something
vaguely like 예ㅖㅖㅖ약하사으트ㅜㅏㅇ느ㅜ아투아 or somenhinh and then
they was like checkin??(in korean) and then like <ruby>성함이 어떻게
되세러대ㅓ뇨요<rt>what is you name</rt></ruby>? and then i say James
bTmjtowotj??? and then they was like uhhhhmhe. and then uhhh.. and then
theey wan like oh myb..?? and i show my phone with my name highlighted
and then they like ok and they give me my key and then like haha cool
but in talking to someone u dont know they language way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>anyways i got to my Room and it was nice. i splurged , paying a whole
USD39.27 for a room that had a bathtub and got higher reviews. i figured
that staying in my Most-Expensive accommodation right after i stayed in
my Least-Expensive (i.e. free) accommodation would be appropriate and
Funny. haha!.</p>

<p>In the night I bathed myself and ate my snacks and also washed my
single pair of shorts in the bathroom sink. Also the floor of the room
got kinda wet so i wiped it up with a bathtowel. this was a mistake bc
the floor turned out to be very dirty and all that dirt ended up on
Bathtowel. so i washed (to the best of my ability) the dirty bathtowel
in the Other sink.</p>

<p>I gained an intention to eat at a <ruby>횟집<rt>restaurant serving
raw (fish)</rt></ruby> so i looked stuff up on naver maps and walked
around approx where they would be. I was walking in the market there was
some 횟집s but the vibes was sort of off idk. i was looking for a
specific store i found on the Map because going to a Specific place was
easier than going to Any place. And then while i was walking , someone ,
i think from a 횟집 , Solicited me to eat at they restaurant. or at
least i think because i only understood like half of the words they said
idk because they solicited with my Wireless earphone in or because i was
Scared or i literally just didnt understand. Since i didnt understand
half of the words i just shook head and hands and made bye-bye body
language and eventually left (i think they said that something was only
KRW15000). I heard another person say to them as i was leaving “isnt
that an japanese person” (but in korean).</p>
<p>Thus i had lost all intention determination motivation to eat at a
횟집 so i thought maybe eat at just any other regular restaurant so
walked a bit away from restaurant looked for one of those but decided No
and then looked up directions to <ruby>경주<rt>GYUNGJU</rt></ruby>. It
turns out u could get to 경주 by taking Regular (you dont have to buy
special tickets) buses. So i got on a Bus towards 경주.</p>

<p>I would have to get off at an Intermediate Place and Transfer to

place and Found one that looked Chill and then Went There and Ate
There.</p>

id="aside-how-to-navigate-a-typical-south-korean-restaurant-alone-with-minimal-dialogue-based-on-my-experiences"
class="aside">
<h3>aside: how to navigate a typical south-korean restaurant Alone with
Minimal Dialogue Based On My Experiences</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter the restaurant and try to make eye contact with a server</li>
<li>the server will probably either
<ul>
<li>ask you how many people you are, in which you can hold up One Finger
to indicate you are Only Yourself</li>
<li>ask you if you are Alone in which you can Just Nonverbally
Affirm</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The server will then tell u to sit somewhere (or anywhere).</li>
<li>The server will then come over and bring you a pitcher of Water or
Tea or so, and sometimes a Menu (if the menu is not just on the Wall).
<ul>
<li>in the case that the menu is on the Wall or left on the table or so,
i have found it Best to simply Order Now when the Server is already At
Your Table. You can do this by Looking like you about to order and
saying “(MENU) 하나 주세요”. in the case you want to order multiple
different things, idk how to do that so good luck lol.</li>
<li>If the menu is Brought to you, to Order i think you basically just
wait until a Server is Relatively Close to your table and Make Eye
Contact And Look Like You About To Order , and then they will come over
Assuming you Ready To Order. And then you can use the “(MENU) 하나
주세요” dialogue. and then they probably take ur menu back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Here comes imo the most awkward part of the Experience: when the
server comes out with ur food and puts it all on the table and feels
awkward and rude to do Nothing but awkward to Say Something. I have
found it optimal to say Thank You (but in korean) except unintelligibley
quietly and mumbly so that you still say something that is probably
expressing your gratitude but without the Pain of Fully Vocalising.</li>
<li>if ur table doesnt have utensils and tissues on the Top Surface,
they are likely in a drawer on the side.</li>
<li>eat</li>
<li>you have finished. it is now time to Pay. Every single restaurant i
have visited you pay at the front counter. If you visit somewhere that
doesnt do that gl bc idk how to do that. In order to pay at the front
counter , sometimes there will be someone that is Always There. However
often there is Not , and in this cases you can initiate the payment
process by Getting Up Looking like you about to Leave and then Walk Over
To The Counter (hopefully you will have seen other people pay so u will
know where it is and know that this is a Pay-At-Counter establishment).
Someone will hopefully See You and walk over to Payment with you.</li>
<li>The person will probably Tell you your Total Money Need To Pay. You
hand them your Money. They will hand you Change if applicable. If they
ask u if u need a receipt or if u pay with Card or if u have any other
slightly different experience than the ones i am describing now, good
luck bc idk how to do those.</li>
<li>this was challenging for me: when do i know if im good to go?
especially if u pay the exact amount and they dont give u any change ,
did i pay correct amount? are they just thinking, counting money i gave
them? In my experience , i usually ended up waiting a bit , then turning
to leave , and usually they say bye bye which probably means u didnt
mess anything up.</li>
<li>congratulations!</li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>And then i left and then went to take the other bus further into
<ruby>경주<rt>GYUNG JU</rt></ruby>. however i got on a bus heading the
wrong direction so i accidentally went into a little town city area.
What a fun detour!</p>
<p>I got off the bus and then walked to the nearby River thing and then
took a little walk. i walked along pathways across some kind of bridge
across some fields under a bridge and then onto some roadway.</p>

<p>i waited at bus stop and bus came and it ended up driving me
literally back to the area that i got off at on accident. so i got off
there, crossed the street , and took the appropriate bus farther into
경주.</p>
<p>I got off somewhere that seemed to be in the ‘city’. however the
vibes were off or sth so i searched up directions Out of the Area ,
decided to take a bus to train station.</p>

<p>At the train station , the vending machines did not take foreign
cards. So i knew i would have to Talk To Person if i wanted ticket. so i
memorised the exact train i wanted , and then walked up to counter and
tried to say “345 SRT…” (but in korean) , and then they asked me where
im going , and i said <ruby>Boosan<rt>부산</rt></ruby>, and then they
said some stuff i forget and payment i gave them KRW50000 bill and then
they asked me if i had <ruby>백원<rt>KRW100</rt></ruby> bc the fare was
KRW1100 , <ruby>코인<rt>coin</rt></ruby> . and i did and gave it and
they gave me change and my ticket and i left and rode train to
<ruby>Boo<rt>부</rt></ruby> <ruby>san<rt>산</rt></ruby>. it was chill
and quite short a ride. on the train i booked a cheap motel and looked
up a 순대국밥 place to eat.</p>
<p>Eventually i arrived <ruby>Busan<rt>부산</rt></ruby> at
<ruby>부산역<rt>busan station</rt></ruby>. i looked around a bit and
then went to go eat at the restaurant i had looked up.</p>

<p>the experience was chill and i ate well. even though i probably could
have happily eaten another bowl of rice but i didnt want to order one. i
payed and left and then went to booked motel.</p>
<p>I arrived at motel , the person behind desk was watching video in a
place that did not have direct line-of-sight with where i was standing.
so i just stood there for a while listening to the asmr of them watching
their video , some guy outside talking on phone in foreign language (idk
what language), and city ambiance. eventually i walked out the motel and
like looked to see that this was the right place . and then walked back
in. and then the person behind the desk saw me through the window and
them attended to the Front Desk. after they noticed that i Couldnt Speak

<p>the room smelled very unpleasant and also there was not any Room
Slippers. also every other motel i has been in had some kind of Box
Tissues , but this motel the only tissues was the roll tissue next to
toilet and a giant Roll Tissue sat on the desk. also there was some
holes in the wall.</p>

<p>I decided to go out and buy some things. The building with the front
desk was for some reason separate from the building that u enter
elevator ride up to ur room , so it was very easy to simply Leave and
not worry do i need to leave my key at the front desk or sth.</p>
<p>I went out bought Sanitary tissues at a Daiso (i had ran out of
Pocket-monster wipes i had bought at Japan), and some snacks at a
convenience store. the self-checkout at Daiso for some reason didnt
recognise the wipes i wanted to buy that was awkward so i just went to
the Person Checkout and then performed a real quick Checkout, very
convenient and seamless and troubleless process. great!.</p>
<p>I returned to my Motel Room and ate my Snacks and took some sort of
shower/bath and Stuff and eventually went to sleep. End of Day 6</p>

<p>This day i woke up. I noticed that even after a whole night of
inhaling the room’s air , it Still somehow smelled Bad and even kind of
stung my nose if i inhaled too deeply.</p>
<p>I exited the Motel and walked north a bit having plans to Do My
Laundry at a coin laundry room (i was wearing my last fresh pair of
innerwear) , and also to Eat <ruby>해장국<rt>HAE JANG
GOOG</rt></ruby>.</p>
<p>I walked to a coin laundry room and went inside. and i saw lots of
instructions. and then someone else walked in and checked on their
laundry and then looked like they was Waiting for they laundry so i Left
and figured i would just walk further North to a Different laundry
room.</p>
<p>I ended up not going to a laundry room , idk why , but i went to a
해장국 place that i looked up , and i did not go in because the vibes
were off there was no customer in there i think. So i looked up and
walked to another restaurant , where there was Some persons in there so
i walk in i ordered my food i got my food (according to my Notes i even
managed to say a small ‘<ruby>감사합니다<rt>thanks you</rt></ruby>’ when
receiving the food , which i assume the person heard bc iirc they
responded with a ‘<ruby>네~<rt>ofc bro</rt></ruby>’). i ate my food. i
paid my food. it was chill.</p>

<p>Then i decided that i wished to drink Alcohol on the Beach , so i
walked to a Convenience store but they didnt have anything that i wanted
. So i decided to walk to an e-mart a bit distance away. i walked there
and browsed the store. and then bought some things and left the
store.</p>

<p>when i was checking out it was one of those conveyor belt checkout
things where u put all ur stuff on conveyor belt and they have Sticks u
can use to separate Your stuff from Other People’s stuff. i put one down
and then my stuff. And then someone else came along carrying a bunch of
stuff i think in just their arms so i put the stick down for them , and
i remember impressionally the silly sight of my little two items wedged

<p>i then walked back to the beach but trying to find a coin laundry on
the way. I almost found one near the beach , but i couldnt figure out
how to Go Up to it (it was on the 2nd floor of some..outdoor shopping
area??) because i went to ride the elevator then in front of me someone
put up a sign that looked like u werent supposed to go up it , and then
started Doing stuff to it?. and i couldnt find any other way up so idk.
I just went to the beach.</p>
<p>On the beach i sat down and ate the little snack that i had purchased
at emart. it was sunny and peaceful and nice.</p>

<p>I arrive the bus terminal. i thought: maybe i can go to
‘<ruby>광주<rt>GWANG JU</rt></ruby>’ which to my knowledge was a major
city to the West of me. But the ticket vending machine didnt got any
tickets to ‘광주’. So, i browsed the locations it had available under
‘<ruby>전라남도<rt>a region West of me</rt></ruby>’, and then i saw the
name ‘<ruby>고흥<rt>GO HEUNG</rt></ruby>’ which sounded cool , and i
looked it up and the location looked cool, so i bought a ticket
there.</p>
<p>I had some time before i had to Ride the bus, so i went into a
convenience store. I end up buy a Banana Milk. I sat at little
convenience-store table sip on my banana milk having a slight allergic
reaction bc im allergic to milk. i was also feeling that rice wine i had
earlier; i thought it was going to be like 5% ABV but while drinking it
i noticed that i was becoming disoriented unusually fast so i looked on
the back and it was 12%. oops!. I wrote in my notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not only am i drunk i am having an allergic reaction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However it was not a severe allergic reaction (i drank the milk bc i
knew i could handle it) so i was Chilling.</p>

<p>Eventually after using bathroom and things i boarded the bus. The
driver was standing out they bus. they saw me looking at bus or so and
asked me sth that i think i thought sounded like asking to see my
ticket. i showed it to them and they gestured towards bus so i went on
it.</p>

<p>there were only approx three other people on the entire bus. i slept
a bit. i booked an accommodation for the night. The bus made several
stops along the way to let ppl on/off and bathroom breaks.</p>

<p>As i rode the bus I looked up directions to the accommodation i had
booked. it looked like it may be pretty far from where i was going to
get off. But it looked like maybe i could take a bus there?. Hopefully i
could catch a bus before they stopped running!!!.</p>
<p>Eventually we reached the <ruby>고흥<rt>GO HEUNG</rt></ruby> stop and
i got off, and looked for the bus stop. I could not find it. I then
think i realised that Iirced i just got off a bus that was headed for
<ruby>녹동<rt>NOK DONG</rt></ruby> , i.e. the place where my
accommodation was. I think that that may have been the bus that i needed
to take. But it was too late. and i only had a ticket to ‘고흥’
anyways.</p>
<p>There was taxis in front of the bus stop. But i was afraid of them.
And i told myself maybe they would be very expensive (idked bc ive never
taken a taxi). So , i started walking. towards my accommodation.
wondering hmm what the heck. im really going to walk , to my
accommodation , which naver maps says is five hours walking? in the
night?.</p>

<p>I just walked . it was dark . I wondered what i was doing why i was
doing it. Once i passed by a bike and i wondered if i should steal it. i
paused there and thought long and hard. i decided not to. because i
would probably be pissed if it was my bike. also it was right in front
of a truck which maybe had a dash cam idk. what if i got arrested that
would be awkward i dont even speak the local language. also the house’s
dog started barking so i moved on.</p>
<p>i walked on , into the darkness. into areas that had no street lamps.
the only light was occasionally cars that drove by. sort of i wished
that someone would stop and ask where u going and offer me to drive me
there. but i also was scared that someone might do that. so i was both
relieved and disappointed that nobody Stopped.</p>
<p>I was walking along the road. Along the road was nature. I often ran
into spider-web material. deeper into my journey , very few cars came.
so, i could just walk in the middle of the road , and move to side if i
heard/saw a car coming.</p>
<section id="aside-running-into-spider-webs" class="aside">
<h3>aside: running into spider webs</h3>
<p>whenever i was in more rural areas i often randomly ran into

<p>Along my way i alternated through periods of being scared i was going
to encounter some rabid animal, periods of wondering wth i was doing,
periods of “hmm this is quite peaceful and chill and romantic”, etc. I
ended up encountering two nonhuman animals face-to-face: one wild animal
that i only saw they outline in the dark. they was as scared of me as i
was of them, so they ran away and we was chill. Another was someone’s
pet dog; i walked by the owner who was idk chilling out they house or
something , and then i walked by they dog who started losing their
marbles and barking intensely while walking following me. the owner told
them to chill tf out and eventually they did.</p>
<p>The most scary part of this walk was the Dogs. not that pet dog where
i could see it and know it was a pet dog owned by the owner i just
walked by, but the ones i couldnt see in the dark. the ones that i
walking in the pitch dark didnt expect anything and suddenly theres this
loud barking coming from nothing in particular. is they feral rabid dogs
coming to bite my leg?? i always wondered this.</p>

<p>Finally after a bit less than five hours I Arrived at my
Accomodation. check in i said some unintelligible things and failed to
understand things and then the person said some english to me and i got
my key and went to the room. I failed to open the room many times until
it finally worked and i went into my room.</p>

<p>It was 1am and i had not eaten dinner. i thought about not eating
dinner. but then i thought about eating dinner. So i went to a 24-hours
<ruby>감자탕<rt>potato soup</rt></ruby> place that i walked by. there
was customers in it. i walked in and idk the vibe was kind of off and
the waiter looked at me kinda funny , and i felt
unusually-more-awkward-than-usual. i ordered food. idk why but i think
the waiter stared at me for an uncomfortably long period of time when i
was ordering like they didnt understand what i was saying. but they got
my order and brought out my food. i decided i wanted to drink alcohol
(idk why. maybe because it would be funny in concept to drink at 1am in
random town i had never been to<sup>[thats actually not funny but i
probably thought it would have been funny]</sup>). So i asked them can i
get bottle of soju. and they just kind of stared at me. and then said u
gotta have id do u have id. and this was literally one of only times i
didnt have my passport on me in south korea (i left at my room), but
also literally the only time anyone or anything has asked me to verify
that i am drinking age in south korea. so i just (nonverbally, probably)
said no and they left.</p>
<p>I ate my stuff. i saw some ppl come in order food and drinks im
pretty sure they werent IDed. i wondered why they decided to ID me . did
i really look like i was young? did they think i snuck out the house at
1am or sth? was it bc i acted weird/awkward when coming in and ordering?
did they think i was chinese or japanese and hated chinese or japanese
ppl? was it bc i ordered the alcohol after food came out instead of
alongside the food? i did not know but i ate.</p>

</figure>
<p>eventually i finished my meal. there was a little bucket for u to put
ur bones in but i felt weird using it bc i was only one person and idk.
I got up and stood at the front counter to pay. The person paying me
asked me sth probably like ‘<ruby>어디서 왔어요<rt>where u
from</rt></ruby>?’. except i didnt really hear so i looked confused
????. then they said sth like ‘jsifoasj?
<ruby>중국<rt>china</rt></ruby>?’ and then i understood they was asking
where im from , and i said ‘<ruby>미국<rt>usa</rt></ruby>’. yes simply
‘<ruby>미국<rt>usa</rt></ruby>’ not even a
‘<ruby>미국이요<rt>usa</rt></ruby>’. and then maybe they were like 🤔
but tbh i dont remember. and they said ‘<ruby>네, 만원<rt>ok,
KRW10000</rt></ruby>’ and i left.</p>
<p>i walked back , showered and wash my teeth , go to sleep. END OF DAY

<p>this day i woke up and left my accommodation. i walked a bit decide i
want to go to a beach , on the little disconnected islands slightly
south where i was. I see that naver maps say i can take a bus. so, i
walk to the bus stop sit there.</p>

</figure>
<p>an Elderish Person also come over to bus stop sit in there. they ask
me where im going (but in korean). uh oh!. i dont really know where im
going except some islands stuff over there. so i just kind of use my
hands to simulate a driving path going over the bridge and over to that
islands over there say ‘shooooooong’ or so to communicate “over there
somewhere ig” and they say ‘<ruby>금산<rt>KEUM SAN</rt></ruby>?’ and i
affirm this even though idk where that is<sup>(i looked it up and it was
slightly farther than i was planning to go , but i guess that is where i
was going now)</sup>. and then no more dialogue for a long time. and bus
dont come. for a long time. it was very awkward i try to blend in with
the bench. but also im wondering im should be saying something idk its
awkward both to say something or to say nothing. but i cant speak i dont
speak korean bro im sorry.</p>
<p>they step out a few times to look around walk around idk ; i think
during these times hmm maybe i should just leave bro. but then i also
think hmm no, i am here and i will probably may never come back here in
my life. so i should just have fun explore cool little islands area or
sth. bus cant be too long away right??. And then i looked at naver maps
and it said that the bus only runs 5 times between 7:00 and 17:50 which
is um…. not very frequent. so i assumed i would have to wait a lot
longer.</p>
<p>Another person came over the bus stop watching some video on their
phone aloud. we all waited at the bus stop. elderlyish person get a
phone call step out the booth to talk it. i decide to leave. i left. i
walk to the bus terminal. the bus terminal ticket vending machine WORKS
and has tickets to <ruby>광주<rt>GWANG JU</rt></ruby>. but it dont take
foreign cards. but the one next to it takes CASH and i use it to BUY A
TICKET to 광주. i think the buses to 광주 were more frequent than the
local buses in the area lmao.</p>

</figure>
<p>I used the bus terminal bathroom (which had a rare Automatic Liquid
Soap Dispenser) and then went to find my Bus. I did actually not know
where my Bus was bc there was no platform explicitly labeled
“<ruby>광주<rt>GWANG JU</rt></ruby>” and my south-korean geography
knowledge is Not Skillfull. However eventually i saw a bus with a ‘광주’
sign in the windshield (the bus itself was i think the same
<ruby>부산<rt>BUSAN</rt></ruby> → <ruby>녹동<rt>NOK DONG</rt></ruby>
labelled bus that i took yesterday) and i went into the bus showed
ticket to driver and they said something that idked but they gestured to
inside of bus so i assumed it was correct.</p>
<p>i sat on bus as it drove to 광주. it started raining. we passed by
some cool lake and mountain area that looked neat and mysterious and
cool.</p>

<p>On the bus i looked up place to eat <ruby>떡갈비<rt>DDEOK
GALBI</rt></ruby> because friend said that it is a 광주 representative
food. I decide on a place look good that was near where i would get off
bus. Bus Arrive , i get off and go that place. However, they say they
have a resting time at 15:00 , and it was like 15:03. How
unfortunate!.</p>

<p>So, i look up ‘떡갈비 광주’ and see this one place looks famous or so
, and i take the subway there. I go in there order eat food. it was very
tasty and fulfilling, perhaps most fulfilling meal i had in South Korea
(also most expensive but worth imo).</p>

<p>I payed and left feeling very fulfilled . and then i went to go do my
laundry. i found a coin laundry room and there was nobody in there.
epic!. i did my laundry. the laundry machines and driers were gigantic ,
but also the laundry cost was kinda expensive like more than KRW6000 for
a standard run in just the washer (no drying). i didnt know there were
two diff sizes of washers so accidentally used the larger one (the
smaller one was also large but less large).</p>

<p>I went to the Kisok that took Cash ; an attendant sayed ‘do u need
any help’ ; i body languaged ‘no thx’. and then found train to seoul but
when i try to get it it say This Machine Dont Accept Cash. and im
confused start over try a different Train and then got confused and then
attendant walk over say ‘this one has transfer’ (so i think i had to
press two buttons instead of one?) and then ‘hmm do u want the faster
(direct) train one??’ (the one that i tried initially to buy). At this
time i tried to get the Transfer one but the machine again said No Cash
Bro , so i simply body languaged ‘thx im good’ and left and mentally
prepared to Having To Go To A Human Counter Again Bc The Ticket Machine
Dont Work. I walked up the counter say ‘seoul’ they say
‘<ruby>용산<rt>yong san</rt></ruby>? <ruby>서울<rt>Seoul</rt></ruby>?’
or sth and idrked where 용산 was within seoul so i just say seoul and
they give me my ticket and circled things on ticket and probably said
some english to me.</p>
<p>I had a cappuccino from a coffee vending machine even though i dont
usually drink coffee. i went to the bathroom. then i went on the train.
the train was chill ig. it was approx 2 hours 10 mins and cost KRW47100.
btw nobody checked my ticket (nobody did on my train from
<ruby>경주<rt>gyung joo</rt></ruby> to <ruby>부산<rt>boo san</rt></ruby>
either) , but the seats were assigned.</p>

<p>i think i got off at <ruby>용산<rt>yong san</rt></ruby> and then went
to somewhere in <ruby>잠원<rt>jam won</rt></ruby>. my plan was to carry
out fried chicken and beer and eat it along the <ruby>한강<rt>han
river</rt></ruby>. i walked to a chicken place, and the vibes were off.
maybe bc it was off-hours (2 or 3pm). So i walked to another chicken
place which was kinda far away. the vibes at that chicken place were
sort of off as well , i think i wanted a kiosk to order at but there was
no kiosk. i also passed by a <ruby>김밥천국<rt>gim bab
heaven</rt></ruby> and had a desire to eat in there but too afraid.</p>
<p>i had a little mental breakdown and asked a friend if they had any
friends around the city that can go with me to eat , and in short they
did not. So, i went to a mcdonalds and ordered stuff , and then stopped
by a convenience store and bought some beer , and also a bowl instant
noodles. as i was preparing my instant noodles with the
<ruby>convenience<rt>store</rt></ruby> hot water machine , the clerk ask
me if im gonna eat in here (idk why but im guessing maybe warn me dont
eat alcohol or outside food [my mcdonalds] inside?) , to which i
responded by making mouth sounds and using hands gesture walking out
door and away or so , lol.</p>
<section id="aside-idk-what-was-up-with-my-mcdonalds-order"

<h3>aside: idk what was up with my mcdonalds order</h3>
<p>when i was walking out the door with my mcdonalds order , a worker
stopped me and said can they look my order verify whether something was
inside or sth(?), and then ig it was ok they sent me on my way.</p>
</section>
<p>Then i walked out carrying my bowl of cup noodles (and its packet of
powder which it said to add once noodles done cooking) (and my
chopsticks) and walked to the <ruby>한강<rt>han river</rt></ruby> ,
which was a frustrating experience. it was far , i accidentally walked
into some kind of apartments area and had to turn back , i crossed some
kind of road which there wasnt a crosswalk u had to walk down stairs
through an underground mall and up stairs again?? , and etc. also i
dropped my noodle powder packet and/or chopsticks more than once.</p>

<p>This night i hadve decide think to spend the night at an
<ruby>찜질방<rt>sauna</rt></ruby> , because it would be cheaper than
cheapest motel and also ive never been to one.</p>
<p>So i looked up one that got good reviews Go there. Here was approx my
checkin process for this place:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>stand in hallway wondering if i should really do this. maybe someone
would pass by i can just follow them in to learn the social script and
follow it.</li>
<li>nobody came</li>
<li>walk in</li>
<li>there was a kiosk outside of the line-of-sight of the front desk. i
use this kiosk select my Options (adult male, i think). this kiosk print
me a receipt with a number.</li>
<li>walk into the lobby. person say me: take off you shoes before coming
in. i do this.</li>
<li>walk in carrying my shoes. probably looking like idk what to do. i
think the person ask me what my number is. and then told me to put my
shoes in the number locker over there. wander over to lockers. they tell
me my locker is at very end. they tell me this again in english when i
probably look like i spending too much time or didnt understand or
sth.</li>
<li>walk back over to counter . them give me <ruby>찜질복<rt>sauna
clothes</rt></ruby> and tell me the male bathroom is over there.</li>
<li>enter male bathroom</li>
<li>congratulations!</li>
</ol>
<p>i undress and store my things in my locker and stuff and enter baths
room. its chill. luckily even though i am deathly afraid of someone talk
to me , idrc about walking around naked in public bath. so i showered ,
enjoyed baths it was nice. i dry , change into sauna clothes , go to the
Common Area thing. i looked around a bit. i went into one hot room it
was cool, chill i left after like 1 min bc didnt really want to sweat. i

chargers n stuff and used phone , someone came in and started

<p>my stuff finished charging i left. they had little cave booths u can
sleep in there. so i went in one. there was already some mats and
pillows in there idk who had used them before me so i replaced them with
‘fresh(?)’ ones that idk were actually ‘fresh’ since the signs say to
put mats n stuff back when ur done with them ; idk when where they
sterilize them.</p>

<h2 id="korea-day-10-seoul">korea day 10 – seoul</h2>
<p>today i woke up in my little cave and then crawled out my little cave
and then took a shower and short bath and then changed into clothes go
to leave. i fetched my shoes from my shoe locker. and then remember i
forgot to use the <ruby>퇴장<rt>exit</rt></ruby> kiosk. I was under
impression based on the pricing charts that i would have to be paying a
bunch of extra money for staying extra time or sth idk. However i need
to pay at that the <ruby>퇴장<rt>exit</rt></ruby> kiosk. However to use
the <ruby>퇴장<rt>exit</rt></ruby> kiosk u need to put ur Key into it.
However i had already fetched my shoes and now the locker dont open let
the key out. dam thats so awkward.</p>
<p>So at front desk i said:
‘<ruby>결제<rt>payment</rt></ruby>……..forgot(hand gesture that hopefully
looks like “forgot”)’. and then they ask me what my number is , get me
to write it down. i wrote it down. they do something with they computer
, say ‘ok u should be able to do it now’ or sth . i went over to the
locker the key still dont come out. oops!. I went back to the front desk
. they say sth like ‘?? does u want to enter?’ and i say No and they was
like ?????. and say sth like ‘what country u from’ and i say ‘usa’ and
they say OK then English?. and i affirm. and they pull up google
translate and get me to speak english into it i speak sth like ‘i forgot
to pay and the key doesnt come out’. and then they look at they computer
and my number and stuff and say ‘this is ur number right??’ and i affirm
and they say ‘it dont have any other charges..?’ and walk over to shoe
locker and open it , walk back to computer . and look a bit and just say
‘u can go it doesnt say any charges’ or so. so , i went (not knowing if
i had just misunderstood the pricing chart informations or i got out
free because of a bug or sth).</p>
<p>I walked away . idk where was walking but i walked Away from there. i
encountered a Train station. how convenient!. I sat in train station a
bit wondering what to do. then i thought: i want to eat mcdonalds
breakfast. So, i decided to go to <ruby>Itaewon<rt>이태원</rt></ruby>.
because i wanted to go there in general , and also it was vaguely near
the <ruby>한강<rt>HAN RIVER</rt></ruby> so maybe i can get mcdonalds and
eat it along 한강.</p>
<p>So i went to there. i hear it is more diverse than other areas of
south korea. and i see that it is, at least while walking through train
station. I walk to a mcdonalds and order food n stuff.</p>
<p>then i walk to 한강. which is kind of a long walk. i walk along a
‘park’ which has walls and barbed wire and says ‘US GOVERNMENT PROPERTY
/ NO TRESPASSING’. ok cool!.</p>

<p>after walking along and crossing a variety of roads and walking
through a train station , i finally arrived at the 한강. there is not
really a nice place to sit along the river , so i keep walking east
along the river try to find a nice spot.</p>

<p>it was about as good as eating cold mcdonalds breakfast underneath a
raised highway could get. Eating cold greasy food made me crave sweet
carbonated beverage , so i wondered if there was any nearby vending
machine. I supposed Not. However i had a bit of hope because i remember
seeing Some vending machines in public places , like at the beach once.
And maybe at a <ruby>한강<rt>han river</rt></ruby> park once. So for fun
i stopped eating , packed up my leftovers , and decided to do a
challenge i call “walking along the han gang until i find a vending
machine challenge”.</p>
<p>I walked for quite a while. i saw some views, bikers, pigeons, picnic
tables, people exercising, people fishing, recreation courts, a
chaperoned ethnically diverse group of small children. However there
were no vending machines.</p>

<p>eventually i gave up and went to a train station. i looked up ‘best
한강 parks’. i decided to go to ‘<ruby>반포<rt>BAN PO</rt></ruby>’ 한강
park because seemed to be number one. took the train there, walked along
a bunch of roads as usual , and arrived at the ‘Park’.</p>

<p>ngl i was not big fan of the park. instead of being a ‘한강’ park it
was more like ‘look at what we built on the 한강’ park. there were a
bunch of random buildings and stuff built into the water idk why.</p>

<p>There were also no vending machines. But there seemed to be a
convenience store. so i walked there. on the door there was a sign
saying they dont sell soju or ramen. i dont really think i was planning
on buying those , but now that they mentioned that bro im not going to
go in and just buy a single soda thats embarassing. so i sat down at
some bench and drank half a bottle of water and a bite of my leftover
sausage sandwich and decided: hmm ok actually maybe i will.<br />
</p>
<p>so i went in and bought a can of Coca-Cola. and left and sat back
down on bench and ate some my leftovers and drank my Coca-Cola.</p>

<p>I took train to nearby area to visit my fav store
<ruby>무인양품<rt>muji</rt></ruby> with intention to buy a sweatshirt bc
my flight to USA home was tomorrow and i expected the plane to be
chilly. on my way to <ruby>무인양품<rt>muji</rt></ruby> i also passed by
a Line Friends and Kakao Friends stores which sell cute character goods
, so i took mental note of them . I walked around the
<ruby>무인양품<rt>muji</rt></ruby> look at the neat things , and then
buy the sweatshirt i came for , exited , go to browse Kakao Friends.
there was cute things n stuff but nothing i really wanted (i wanted to
buy one of those THINGS U ATTACH TO BACK OF PHONE AND ITS A GRIP AND U
CAN EXTEND AND RETRACT IT, or maybe a wrist Strap).</p>
<p>And then i go browse Line Friends. in that store i saw that they
still had a little display set up from a popup store collaboration thing
they did with The South-Korean Global Pop Sensation NewJeans which was
cool and even had leftover merch. However i convinced myself that i do
not need Material Objects that i do not need. I was thinking of buying a
little frog/chicken(?) character ADHESIVE GRIP THING and a phone wrist
strap. However after hesitating for a long time , i decided Not to bc it
was expensive af. I walked back over to the South-Korean Global Pop
Sensation NewJeans corner and looked at the things again they were cute
and cool , however nothing i actually ‘needed’. However i remember
seeing online that in this collaboration they had a phone wrist strap
thing that could be actually useful if i bought it. However they dont
have it here. However i know theres another relevant line friends store
in <ruby>HONGDAE<rt>홍대</rt></ruby>, so i decided to go there.</p>
<section id="aside-i-found-out-that-홍대-is-literally-just-홍대"
class="aside">
<h3>aside: i found out that <ruby>홍대<rt>hong dae</rt></ruby> is
literally just <ruby>홍대<rt>hong uni</rt></ruby></h3>
<p>before i came to south korea i had heard of the area of seoul named
‘<ruby>홍대<rt>hongdae</rt></ruby>’ and the university
‘<ruby>홍익대학교<rt>hongik university</rt></ruby>’. however i didnt
know they was actually related until i was reading a subway map in south
korea and saw ‘<ruby>홍대입구<rt>entrance to hong uni</rt></ruby>’
station where i 🤔🤔 thats funny is that ‘hongdae’? and then figured out
i think it is. and so i learned that 홍대 means 홍대.</p>
</section>
<p>I take the Train there. In the <ruby>HONGDAY<rt>홍대</rt></ruby>
station i walked past a rack of those adhesive phone grips they were
cute and also cheaper than line friends. I continue on, go to exit
station. i think: maybe i come back to examine them on my way back idk.
However, right before i exit i think: hmm idc idgaf. and then turn back
, go back to rack , buy a cute little avocado grip that match my phone
color perfectly. and then go back exit walk to line friends.</p>
<p>Line friends dont have what i was looking for so i exit walk back.
but on the way i passed by a lotteria burger that said sth about
<ruby>무인<rt>NO PERSON</rt></ruby> beer dispensing and i 🤔 and then
walked in. There was a whole <ruby>무인<rt>NO PERSON</rt></ruby>
ordering system it was very advanced. so i bought food.</p>

<p>Then, i take train to <ruby>여의도<rt>YEOUIDO</rt></ruby>
<ruby>한강<rt>han river</rt></ruby> park. why? because i saw
<ruby>여의도<rt>yoido</rt></ruby> on the lists of ‘good 한강 park’ and i
heard name before and also <ruby>여의도<rt>YO I DO</rt></ruby> sounds
way cooler than ‘<ruby>반포<rt>BANPO</rt></ruby>’ in my humble

unobstructed View of River and stuff , large flat areas with some
greenery. terrific!.</p>
<p>I went to the Seven-Eleven on the water and bought an Alcohol and
then sat at a Picnic table and Ate my food, which was still pleasantly
warm (i didnt have to walk 15 mins through a bunch of roads bc there was
a train station right into the Park🥰).</p>

<p>At some point , spontaneously , or perhaps in a moment of weakness ,
i decided to go back to Line Friends store buy some The South-Korean
Global Pop Sensation NewJeans merch. tbh i didnt even know when the
store closed bc i didnt have mobile data. however idced ; i wrote in my
notes: “if its closed i consider it the higher powers protect me from my
moment of weakness. if it dont then idk lol.”</p>
<p>I rode the train from <ruby>여의도<rt>YO I DO</rt></ruby> to
<ruby>강남<rt>GANG NAM</rt></ruby>. there was lots of people in the
train system. in fact there was a Line for the train , which is first
time i had ever seen one of those in any country. when i got off the
train walk to the line friends , i also saw a long queue for i think a
Bus. which i also had never seen before.</p>

<p>Line friends was not closed and i bought some Stuff. i walked back to
Station and used wifi to look up a <ruby>찜질방<rt>sauna</rt></ruby> to
stay at for The Night. There was one Nearby so i go to walk to it. at
some point i had to a giant-ass road with no obvious crosswalk and it
seem you have to go into underground area cross over. there was homeless
guy sleeping i think on the stairs with styrofoam tray in front of them
with some money in it. i passed by them like every other homeless person
i had in my life (for reference i was raised in a
homeless-people-are-scum-that-are-homeless-bc-they-are-bad-people-type
environment) , but i came back gave some money bc</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>i just dropped like KRW 30,000 on some silly trinkets so what even
is money</li>
<li>i doubt ill even convert back my KRW into USD just keep it as

<li>idc and idgaf</li>

<p>I was basically arrived , but then i thought: dang it is only 8pm.
ive never done anything at night in city. “night life” or something. but
then i think: bro i dont ever do “night life” what is there even to do
at night. what would you even do at night. go to paris baguette? (i saw
a paris baguette across the road). So, i crossed the road and went into
paris baguette.</p>
<p>idked paris baguette i had never been into a paris baguette except
briefly walked through one in new york city. i selected a
‘<ruby>단팥크림빵<rt>sweet bean cream bread</rt></ruby>’ and then wait
in the queue to pay; ahead of me was someone buying just like five
sausages and someone buying a banquet’s worth of pastries and drinks. i
payed it was not expensive iirc. and then sat down at the little eating
area.</p>
<p>They had free wifi and charging stuff built into the tables which was
very nice. i sat there and applied my adhesive avocado phone grip i
bought earlier and plugged stuff in to charge and used phone and ate my
bread. it was chill.</p>

<p>eventually it was 9pm and i decided that i had had enough night life
for the day and went to the <ruby>찜질방<rt>sauna</rt></ruby>. here was
my experience entering it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>enter</li>
<li>the person behind counter said hi and told me to put my shoes in the
shoe locker i think <ruby>34<rt>삼십사</rt></ruby></li>
<li>i struggled to open locker <ruby>44<rt>사십사</rt></ruby> because i
dont hear it correctly</li>
<li>they come over to see whats wrong and oh its bc im opening wrong
locker lol</li>
<li>i put my shoes in locker</li>
<li>them say ‘i help u with the payment here’ or sth while walk me to
the counter</li>
<li>i pay. it is KRW14000. according to the receipt i paid with foreign
credit card no problem.</li>
<li>them walk me into the locker room and show me and explain me
stuff.</li>
<li>thats it i didnt have to say any words just hopefully Nonverbally
Express Thanks.</li>
</ol>
<p>bathtime was chill. though there were a lot of guys that had shaved
heads and large tattoos which was a bit 🤔 , though i had a shaved head
as well so i was not really one to 🤔. Another thing that had me 🤔 was
that the Single Sink in the baths area was labelled
<ruby>양치금지<rt>BRUSHING TEETH FORBIDDEN</rt></ruby> and say please
brush you teeth in shower or so. I had seem people brush teeth in shower
or so but i thought it was them just taking a little shortcut shower and
brush teeth at same time or so , i didnt know its actually like A Thing
to brush ur teeth in the showers. but ig it was. also there were
(public) toothbrushes and toothpaste for u to use if u dont have ur own
🤔. tbh idrked how to brush my teeth in the shower i like kind of
brushed and then spat my mouth waste Nearish the drain and close to the
floor so it wouldnt splash everywhere. and then like tried to make the
water wash it down the drain. idk. idked.</p>
<p>eventually im done bathe and brush teeth n stuff , and i followed
behind someone to the main area bc i afraid if i look around too much
someone might ask if i need help.</p>
<p>i went into a hot room and exited after 1 min again, conveniently
after another person entered. I sat in the common area in a little cave
using phone and such. i heard one guy (btw this was an male-only sauna)
order a <ruby>미역국<rt>seaweed soup</rt></ruby> from the restaurant.
there were TV sounds and such.</p>
<p>eventually i went into a Sleeping area, which was Dark area with lots
of little booths where u can sleep in. They have blankets and pillow in
them. i think settle down in an area. but then get up, go out and get
another blanket, look around, find an area that looked better , lie down
there. The blankets and pillows and area in general smelled pristine
btw. the best-smelling accommodation i stayed in in south korea.</p>
<p>I used phone a while (they had usb-c fast chargers in all the booths.
cool!.). Eventually, go to sleep probably. End of day 10.</p>

<p>went through airport security and stuff. ICN Had those huge X-Ray
machines. i asked (in english) sth like ‘can i got pat-down. no x-ray
machine’ , and stuff , and eventually got the message across , and i got
the shortest pat-down i have ever received.</p>
<p>Inside the gates i looked and could not find a convenience store in a
timely manner. there was plenty of luxury brand stores though. i also
ate an airport food at a restaurant. tbh it was kinda meh and i sort of
wish i had just gotten taco bell to see what korea taco bell would taste
like.</p>
