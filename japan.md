![8.27 04:47 GMT+9: landing pic](pics/20230827_044752.jpg)

first thing i did was figure out immigration and customs (the two things u have to do to exit airport). i think u could write fill out a form. but i also saw some youtube video or sth before that you can fill out online and gives u qr code or sth and can just scan and is maybe marginally faster or more convenient. so i did that. the most difficult thing was writing where i was going to stay, partially because i have no clue how japanese addresses work, and also idk where i was going to stay. so i looked up some random hotel that i potentially could maybe stay and put that down. and it worked and i went thru the immigration and customs without much problem. though when i was going through customs the guy handling stuff or something looked at my stuff and said [これだけ](just this)? and i responded in english something like "yeah" and then they asked in english again "just this?" i think and i responded sth like "yes just this" and they kind of like poked around in my reusable grocery bag of stuff while i awkwardly fumbled around with the customs QR code digital machine something.

anyways i finally passed all the stuff and ended up in The Airport where tbh i didnt really know what to do. i thought about should i get some kind of sim card type of deal so i can have mobile data around japan? i saw some kind of counter areas that sold them probably , but i didnt want to interact with the people it was scary. so i just sat around looking stuff up on my phone on the very unreliable airport wifi . i bought an USD 8 dollar esim data thing . and then discovered my phone doesnt use ESIM, which was unfortunate. <small>but at least i saved USD 8.5 by not taking JFK airtrain so it evens out (::</small>

I Withdrew Japan JPY money from airport ATM , by using credit card. how it works is i had to set up credit card 'cash withdrawal' or sth pin, then i use machine, and it worked. Looking at my credit card statement, it didnt show any fees, so i expected that there wasnt any fees.

<div class=aside>
### aside: i was wrong
there were fees for withdraw cash with my credit card. it just didnt CHARGE ME THE FEE UNTIL IT ACTUALLY APPROVED/THE CHARGE FULLY "WENT THROUGH", which took something like three or four days?? THANKS LOL.

i wonder if i could use debit/atm card. but mine is expired and my bank doesnt plan on giving me a new one so idk.
</div>

idrk what else i did i probably used the bathroom and told my parents my plane didnt explode. i also came across the famous legendary Japan Vending Machine.

![8.27 08:00 GMT+9: The Famous Japan Vending Machines. when first seeing it i thought: huh wow thats not that expensive. I come from USA where all vending machines cost like 4 or 5 USD dollars or sth, esp at places where ppl are likely to actually use them. note: i went to japan when 1 USD = 130 JPY approx.](pics/20230827_080002.jpg)

Eventually i decided to Leave The Airport. To do this i looked for signs that indicated some kind of train. i also looked up and seem u gotta take "Keikyu line" out the airport because the "main" network doesnt connect(?) to tokyo haneda airport ?

<div class=aside>
### aside: japan train companies and lines

one thing i discovered shortly before or after arriving in japan is that there are a lot of different companies running train lines. like if u look at a map of the tokyo area trains, there are the Japan Railways (JR) lines <sup>(which i interpret to be the biggest company because idk thats just what it feels like. also it has Japan in its name)</sup>, but there are also a gazillion other different companies lines going everywhere. and if ur at a train station theres often signs for "JR lines" versus like [大江戸線](another line thing run by different company) or um the aforementioned [keikyu](京急) line (also run by diff company), and many others that idk bc ive never taken them.

in practicality I don't think there is much difference between most and they look and feel basically the same , buy tickets same , i think u can use same IC/transportation card the same<sup>(idk because i never bought an IC card)</sup>. but they are in separate areas of large station n stuff and are just . different i guess.
</div>

<div class=aside>
### another aside: japan train, paying

how do u pay get on train in japan??. in this section i talk about how u can pay to ride most train in japan on major lines probably.

#### IC card
japan, like many other areas that i have seen of the world, has a thing called "IC card", which is little card that u can press to things and it goes BEEP and and it pays for things and stuff. to my understanding u BEEP it when u go thru entrance gate, BEEP it when u leave exit gate, it automatically charge u based on distance travelled. i personally have never used this in japan , i think i saw they were having a shortage of them or something. and tbh paying with cash and using physical tickets is so very convenient in japan i never really found the need to be more convenient. though i wonder if there is discount for using IC card bc ik in south korea there was a discount OH WELL

#### physical ticket
at each station hopefully there is a digital ticket machine. u press "ticket" or something and then press one of many set numeric values. and then it asks u for MONEY , in my experience these machines only accept cash . u give it the money, it gives u the ticket worth the NUMERIC VALUE THAT U PRESSED (and your change). then to enter the gate, u put it in the thing. it punches ur ticket and gives it back to u and lets u thru. and when u exit u put it into the thing and if your ticket amount is appropriate (greater or equal) it eats ur ticket and lets u thru, and if it is too little money worth, it says NO BRO and u cant go thru and it gives u back ur ticket. and usually i think there is a Machine inside the gates where u can insert ur ticket and pay the difference and u can go thru or something (FARE ADJUSTMENT MACHINE)? but the one single time i tried to use this it did not work. and i had to go talk to someone very awkwardly and i said sth like "fare adjustment" and then they did some calculations and then showed my calculator with money i need to pay and i gave it to them and left.

note: FARE ADJUSTMENT MACHINE does not give u a refund if you have a ticket worth more than u actually need to pay. i tried this.

How do you know HOW MUCH VALUE TICKET U NEED??, at your departing station they will have a map of the nearby area with numeric values at each nearby station telling u HOW MUCH U NEED TO PAY IN TICKET VALUE. here is an example

<!-- ![9.2 16:18 GMT+9: train fare map](pics/20230902_161821.jpg) -->

![9.1 07:41 GMT+9: heres a train fare map on Top. there is also a ticket machine Below which is displaying Numeric Values. It may be helpful to Zoom In to see things.](pics/20230901_074132.jpg)

#### OTHER
once i went to small ish city town area , and i think the train station only had a little like cute ticket vending machine that only took cash or sth , and there were no automatic gates just people that checked ur ticket that was wild . though unfortunately i didnt ride it bc i didnt want to interact with ticket checking person.

</div>

<div class=aside>
#### aside: japan cash paying machines
it is relatively easy to pay with cash in Japan compared to the Handful of Developed Countries That I Have Visited. In many situations (e.g. Seven Eleven, Train Ticket Machines, Probably More) that you Find Yourself Paying with Cash, often there is a Machine that you Insert your Cash in Yourself, instead of handing the Cash to a human. These Machines often have Neat Features, including you can Place A Stack Of Bills in the slot and it will eat them all in one go (instead of insert one at a time), and also there is large funnel u can throw all ur coins in at once (instead of insert one at a time). Coming from USA Where I Never saw this kind of device, it Surprised me and Delighted me. Let Me Know If You Country Has Such A Similar Devices Down In The Comments Below.
</div>

<span class=drop-caps>anyways i went took the</span> train. it was my first time on a japan train tbh i had no clue what i was doing i stood there in the train looking at the map wondering where exactly i was going. at the airport the fare listed to get to [SHINAGAWA](品川) station was uhh idk like 400 yen or sth? i actually dont remember. but i bought that amount ticket and boarded a train that seemed to be going towards [SHINAGAWA](品川). at one point i think it stopped and i wondered hmm whys it stopped. was it the final stop? so i just got off bc it seemed like it was gonna go back the other way. i think it did. though some ppl i think just kept sitting on the train, i am not sure why they kept sitting since it was going back where it came from. or maybe i just am hallucinating.

![8.27 08:18 GMT+9: i took this picture on the TRAIN out of TOKYO HANEDA INTL AIRPORT. it was relatively EMPTY. one thing that shocked me that the seats were CUSHIONY and UPHOLSTERED like they was actually SPRINGY bro. i thought: hmm, maybe its just bc its a train coming out of the airport so they want it to be extra nice. but no , upholstered cushiony seats were common in my travels within east and central japan.](pics/20230827_081836.jpg)

![8.27 08:25 GMT+9: a sign that i took a picture of bc i didnt really know what it was telling me. i now believe that it is telling u exactly which DOOR and CAR this gate opens to based on TRAIN LENGTH. coming from the USA this was a great CULTURE SHOCK. let me know down in the comments below if you are country has a SIMILAR DOOR CAR LABELLING ON TRAINS.](pics/20230827_082541.jpg)

i transfered to a train that seemed to continue to go to [SHINAGAWA](品川). and it went to [SHINAGAWA](品川). then i got out and walked out the station. There did not seem to be much, though to be fair i didn't walk across the crosswalk. so i just decided to go to farther into tokyo. i decided to [SHINJUKU](新宿). i dont know why i decided to go there. maybe bc location looked good, maybe bc name looked cool, idk. i dont think ive actually ever heard of [SHINJUKU](新宿).

![here is a map of probably the path i took on trains to [SHINJUKU](新宿)](pics/japan-1-map.png)

![8.27 09:43 GMT+9: first pic i have of japan city: [SHINJUKU](新宿)](pics/20230827_094319.jpg)

<span class=drop-caps>the first p</span>icture i took of shinjuku was trash in front of vending machines. in My Youth i occasionally encountered Online Communities Very Keen As Japan As A Concept. I Remember One online post which some kind of Praise Japan as Very Clean, So much so that When Waste Disposal Receptacle is full, the Japanese Person will Place the Waste Around The Waste Disposal Receptacle. finally, i witness this "behavior" in my Own Eyes, though Tbh ive literally seen the same thing in e.g. new york city but new york city still smells like urine and trash and weed. Any ways, I walked around shinjuku station . here were some first impressions i remember having

- there is a Wendy's (i know Wendy's from USA)
- there are small Streets with lots of stores and signs or something and stuff
- there are large Roads that are very Big with Cars

Yes, There were both Small Streets but also Large Roads. The Large Roads apparently left a greater impression on me, as i took pictures of them (i did not the small streets).

![8.27 10:08 GMT+9: Large Road](pics/20230827_100819.jpg)

![8.27 10:33 GMT+9: Another Large Road](pics/20230827_103305.jpg)

tbh it felt kind of empty and i think i was experience some kind of light disillusionment. i think i watched too many urbanist youtube videos and assumed that any non-U.S. city would be some kind of paradise where everyone is frolicing in car-free streets and rainbows and stuff. but , this was not the case. it was noticeably clean and smelled good<sup>(not bad)</sup> , at least after spending the last month(s) in new york city.

<div class=aside>
### THOUGHTS ABOUT city layout
i was raised in very Rural area for basically my whole life and the only city ive really been to for an extended period of time is New York City (NYC). especially in NYC manhattan , it feels very . . uniform and grid-y. everything is in a GRID and u have large areas that are simply 1st street, 2nd street, 3rd street, blah blah blah , and u can identify the general area of a spot by saying e.g. "40th street and 6th avenue" like ur plotting a point on a coordinate plane. Also every street looks about the same . is about the same width with same-looking sidewalks . and the only thing that distinguishes them is what is along them.

i think , most areas of japan i went to were not griddy. they kinda went up and down and diagonal and idk . i still dont know how japans addressing system works . i don't think I looked at street names for 90% of my navigations i just looked at gps and guessed , followed signs, etc. Also, esp in cities, Japan streets varied a lot. there were large Roads and then small streets coming off of them, and then some streets that were noticeably intended for Pedestrians, and stuff. the Density of Stuff seemed more Uneven, and that made sense. but it was unfamiliar to me As Someone Grew Up In Rural Suburban USA. Leave A Comment Down Below How Does You Nation Design Cities :).
</div>

I continued to walk around Shinjuku Station. I decided to try to go into a "Bic Camera" store, because i read something online say they sell SIM cards. So i went up entered a large Bic Camera store, and there were people employees standing around looking like they want to help you they gonna talk to u looked like. So i simply left and walked away, and decided to go to a park.

i walked to the park. the scenery along the way was uninspiring . big roads. tall buildings. not many people. i saw some homeless people encampment underneath some bridges, they had signs put up that included English that said to not take pictures/videos of them . i saw some pigeons.

i arrived the park. it was ok, it looked like a city park. there was free wifi so i sat down and used phone for a while probably.

![8.27 10:38 GMT+9: picture of pigeon](pics/20230827_103811.jpg)

![8.27 10:38 GMT+9: second picture of pigeon. i like these pictures of pigeon they are some of fav pictures i took on trip.](pics/20230827_103824.jpg)

![8.27 10:47 GMT+9: uninspiring and also crooked picture of city from park.](pics/20230827_104704.jpg)

![8.27 10:48 GMT+9: water in park](pics/20230827_104828.jpg)

![8.27 11:35 GMT+9: a large road](pics/20230827_113525.jpg)

<div class=aside>
### mine internet connectivity
i did not buy a sim card in japan and thus had no mobile data. thus i couldnt really look stuff up while walking .

i did download offline google maps . which occasionally came in handy to look up a location probably ?. probably

GPS worked without data . but it was a bit wonky like it was off by a few meters usually and took a long time to update position.

when i needed internet, there was occasionally internet in places like:

1. train stations . usually had the most "reliable" public internet (which still wasnt very reliable).
2. in some urban areas, e.g. shinjuku , there is just random public wifi out around. usually very spotty and randomly cant connect.
3. convenience stores sometimes have some form of wifi at them. often do not though , in my experience. also questionable reliability.
4. random stores, department stores occasionally have free wifi. these are usually fairly reliable. sometimes.
5. the place where you are staying for the night. usually reliable internet. very good!

in summary my internet connectivity was a bit painful except for number 5. the end.
</div>

Eventually came Lunch Time, and it was time for me to Eat Lunch.

i looked up Went to a convenience store. i selected a Lunch Box from there cost JPY 498. i hand Stuff to cashier. they ask me if i want my Lunch Box heated up (in japanese). I reply with affirmative body language and "yes please" (in english). they then reply i think [バック](bag)? (in english). And i reply with negative body language, probably sth like shaking head/hand n stuff. they give me my Now-Heated Lunch Box, and I Leave The Store; They Give Me The Typical Farewell Greeting And I Probably Try To Reciprocate It With Light Body Language probably While Leaving. And so ended my Silly adventure at the Convenience store.

<div class=aside>
### social anxiety

I think I have social anxiety. I often do not want to speak; I do not know why. It just feels sort of scary. And I really do not want to.

I have this problem, perhaps more, in foreign languages. I think I may be afraid of saying something silly or sounding silly or idk. I was am deathly afraid of speaking foreign languages, especially when it is not "strictly necessary".

On This Trip, This created many silly situations when I simply Did Not Talk, instead using body language to convey basic meaning.
</div>

<div class=aside>
### japanese
I watched lots of Japanese Animation in middle-high school supplemented with self-studying various Stuff. So I could can understand basic japanese Phrases and can usually get basic meaning of Things even if i do not understand the whole Thing That Is Said To Me.

That Being Said , i have outputted Japanese approximately Zero or One or Two times in my life, and i predict my output skill is basically Zero, or at least my confidence in it is Zero. i think i said , in total , a single comprehensible Japanese Word in my entire trip: "[シャワー](shower)" , which idk even counts.
</div>

With my lunch box I went back to the park, bought a drink from a vending machine, and sat down at a table. I ate my lunch.

![8.27 11:57 GMT+9: my lunch](pics/20230827_115725.jpg)

Then i walked around to places to Stores to try to find a Coin Wallet Purse thing because i realised that i needed to carry Coins around. i also wanted to try to find a bag that was not my Reusable Grocery Bag to carry my belongings (its thin handles were digging into my shoulder). However , I ended up not buying anything. I simply Walked Around a lot.

![8.27 12:58 GMT+9: A Street or Large Paved Area or sth next to A Road. it was slightly sprinkly rain.](pics/20230827_125852.jpg)

![8.27 15:06 GMT+9: pigeons in train station](pics/20230827_150628.jpg)

For dinner , i decided to eat [MCDONALDS](マック). why ? im not sure. maybe, because i could use mobile app and dont interact with human. except when i pick up order. which i had to. but i did it. i ordered it packaged takeaway. But, while waiting for food i discovered there was seating upstairs. oops!. i went upstairs. and eated my packaged mcdonalds. they put the drink in a plastic bag, which was a culture shock i never had that happen. leave a comment below if ur country gives u drink in plastic bag.

![8.27 16:26 GMT+9: mcdonalds](pics/20230827_162638.jpg)

my order was:

- Roasted Soy Sauce Double Thick Beef
- McFry (L)
- Sokenbicha (L)

it was cool, yummy. the Sokenbicha is some kind of tea, refreshing.

<span class=drop-caps>i then went to</span> a convenience store and bought a toothbrush and toothpaste and case little set thing, and a bottle of water.

then, it was time to Go Somewhere To Sleep. i dont actually remember but i assume i was tired from time difference and walking around and stuff. after some consideration throughout the day and research probably, i decided to go to [まんが喫茶マンボー新宿南口](MANGA CAFE MANBOO, SHINJUKU SOUTH EXIT).

<div class=aside>
### aside: japan manga/net cafe
japan has some establishments advertised as like manga/net cafe, 24h workspace, etc. which are basically u pay some money to rent a little cubicle or room (probably with a computer) for some amount of time. you can sleep and stuff in them ; they even sell toiletries and sometimes have coin laundry machines and showers and stuff. As you will see , i spent most of my nights in Tokyo lodging in a specific Chain of this kind of stores called '[manboo](マンボー)' bc in the first night i already got used to that chain and they gave me a membership card.
</div>

i arrive at the building. entrance is at upper floor. i walk up the building and experience anxiety at the door. then press the door and walk in. and then um i think , i like stood there awkwardly , and then , probably approached counter , and then honestly i dont remember , maybe because i dont want to remember. i think i remember pointing at something on the price sheet. and i also remember the employee pulled out this cool cute little translator thing where u can talk into it and it translates it and then u can show it to ur opponent. i experienced some confusion i think once the translaty thing said sth about the top floor being empty or sth ? but i think it had to do with vacant and empty being same concepts and me forgetting that bc in english i think they are more separate.

anyways after somewhat dying i somewhat survived and they gave me , not a key , but a receipt. assigned me a room. actually not a room it was cubicle style . it was a cube. i went to my Cube.

![8.27 19:26 GMT+9: my cube (picture taken after i got usb, as discussed below)](pics/20230827_192633.jpg)

the cube was not locked . but there was a combination safe for safe keeping things if desired. i got the um . "flat" room, which is essentially like a raised floor that is cushioned with firm pleather cushioning so u can sit or lie down on it. also , it came with two pleather cushions !.

the price ended up being um i think JPY 4000 for 15 hours. which is actually i think one of most expensive lodgings i stayed in. i simply must check out at 15 hours after my check in and i am good . if not they charge more .

i wished to shower. on an information sheet on the cube wall i believe it said to bring ur receipt to front desk . so i brought my receipt to front desk . and said the single word [シャワー](shower) but really slowly and traily offy and hesitant so it wasnt as obvious i didnt know any other word than [シャワー](shower). and then the same person that had communicated with me with the cute little translation device thing gave me a briefing on the shower in fully japanese and i nodded and gave affirmative body language and took the shower key they gave me , and went to shower and showered . oh also I Think they asked me if i needed a towel which would cost money and i replied negatively (I Think). the shower was nice!

![8.27 17:56 GMT+9: the shower](pics/20230827_175613.jpg)

<div class=aside>
### japanese bath and shower
among all the countries i have Been To In My Life, japanese showers and baths have been the most Positive experience. i like the design where the shower is an entire little Room with a folding door. u can shower as u please spray water up down anywhere without worrying ur gonna mess something up. i like the Drains where the drain is not actually just a Hole , but removable flooring that covers an area that goes into a Hole. i have not shown any Baths yet but baths are nice , good practical balance of Height and width.
</div>

after shower i probably sat in my room idk doing what. i decided i wanted to use the cube's computer. but, the screen says something like please insert usb to unlock computer or sth. and when i boot up computer it goes into a default user, then some software starts up and it displays please insert usb to unlock. so i figured perhaps some kind of security system u need a usb to unlock. so i typed up a message saying sth like "i want to use computer but it says blah blah blah do i need some kind of usb?" and reverse translated it to make sure it made sense, then went to front desk and showed them my message . and person read it and ummm i dont really remember what they said but i remember i went and got my passport and gave it to them and then i think they filled out some kind of membership registration form , they asked me to write my name on the form i think and then they did some stuff idk i remember just standing there in front lobby right next to the bookshelf of gravure magazines wondering what i was doing , in life , in general , but eventually they gave me my very own manboo membership card :) and a usb , which i took back to room , and plugged into computer , and it worked.

The computer was interesting , it had 4gb of ram which tbh doesnt sound like too little but even basic web browsing it frequently out-of-memoried , froze up. also the manboo portal home site thing had three large central buttons that u might be able to see in picture of Cube above: Manga lookup, Videos, and Adult Videos. all the essentials of life !.

Soon i was ready to go to sleep. it was very cold . information says that u can borrow blankets free at an station, but i went the station and couldnt see any. unfortunate!. i was cold. i thought about going to front and asking but i was done , i had had Enough interaction. but i think it was on my way back from trying and successfully using the Free Drink Machine at the front which dispenses a little paper cup and drink inside it, i passed by the station again and noticed that the towels were at the station . i had simply not seen them bc it was dark. so i got two blankets (they werent that big). and then i go to sleep. oh also i brushed teeth before sleeping in the bathroom.

even with two blankets the aircondition was literally blowing Onto me so i was still a bit chilly. also even though i was staying on the nonsmoking floor , the entire place smelled vaguely of smoke. and my towel that was drying on a hanger smelled like cigarettes in the morning. END OF DAY 1

![here is approx where i went in shinjuku on day 1.](pics/japan-1-2.png)

## japan day 2 -- tokyo

i woke up day 2 at approx 4am probably bc adjusting to japan time .

![8.28 04:02 GMT+9: me waking up at 4am turning on tv , some kind of historical something drama was on this channel.](pics/20230828_040225.jpg)

i probably wanted to go back to sleep ? but i did not iirc. after using bathroom sink i used the Free Drink machine to get a cup of hot tea, and accidentally a cup of cold tea with crushed ice in it. and then i sat in my Cube . after sitting in my Cube for a while i packed up all my stuff back into my trusty reusable grocery bag and left the Lodging Around 7.

<div class=aside>
### aside: checking out of an [manboo](マンボー)
when i went to the front counter to check out , i believe the person asked sth like [終了ですか](termination?) or sth with [終了](SYUURYOU) in it , and i responded affirmatively and then they take my receipt and scan it or sth and then say ok u can go or sth and i left.
</div>

I wanted to go to restaurant called Denny's , because I have seen that 'family restaurants' are cool and epic in Japan. and also because there is Denny's in USA so it would be cool to go to Denny's in Japan. So, i walked to a Denny's.

When i arrived at Denny's i gained Anxiety and did not want to go into Denny's. So i continued walking North and East within Shinjuku, because in that direction i read was some kind of Korea-Town area, which sounded Interesting.

On the way i bought three Rice Balls and a bottle of Tea at a seven-eleven. and then i kept walking East and North intending to sit down somewhere when i found a spot to sit down and Eat them.

Eventually i reached some kind of area that looked like a Korea-Town because there was Korean Writing on signs and stuff. however i did not find a place to sit ; i went to some kind of park thing but it was closed , so i simply ate some rice ball standing in street. I continued to walk around and sometimes eat rice ball and drink tea , and i think i also got some fruits drink from a vending machine and drank that, yum!.

![8.28 08:57 GMT+9: some stickers on a thing i saw in the Area](pics/20230828_085741.jpg)

![8.28 09:08 GMT+9: i passed by many bikes and scooters with random trash in their bins compartments. i am not sure the reason behind this phenomenon.](pics/20230828_090759.jpg)

![8.28 10:03 GMT+9: i passed by this vietnamese restaurant (squirrel), also this taekwondo place.](pics/20230828_100324.jpg)

after wandering around doing nothing in particular , i decided to try to go to a library to use wifi. i am not sure why i wanted to use wifi, but i did . so i looked up a library on offline google maps , and i went there. there was no wifi . but i looked around the library for a few mins , and left. i then went to this lunch box place that i passed by earlier and looked cool . i simply went in , and then chose an lunch box. and also a grape fanta bc the lunch box seemed too cheap and i felt like i was ripping them off by just buying a single lunch box . i payed for my things by going to the counter and then giving the person the money and stuff and then leaving.

I went to a park that i had wandered by and briefly sat in earlier and ate my food. the food was nice. the grape fanta was sweet and carbonated and tbh i think gave me a tummy ache .

![8.28 10:36 GMT+9: i bought and ate this. picture taken in park on bench.](pics/20230828_103629.jpg)

![8.28 10:58 GMT+9: pigeons in the park](pics/20230828_105840.jpg)

![8.28 10:58 GMT+9: pigeon in the park](pics/20230828_105845.jpg)

Then i walked to a train station and Left shinjuku, went to [Akihabara](秋葉原) , which is one of the like three locations that i knew the existence of beforehand in tokyo .

![a map of approx my path on Day 2 of japan in Shinjuku, starting at bottom Manboo , ending at top at [新大久保駅](shin ookubo station). i took the yamanote line to akihabara afterwards but idk if i took it clockwise or counterclockwise.](pics/japan-2-1.png)

<span class=drop-caps>i decided t</span>o first go to a lodging , drop things off , and then walk around the area. Because it was tiring carry my grocery bag. so i decided on an [MANBOO](マンボー) location closeish to akihabara station which had a coin shower according to their website. i wanted Coin Shower because that means i can take shower without talking to the Front desk.

So i went there and i dont exactly remember how i got a room. i think I typed up an message on my Cell phone and showed it to them asking if they got any rooms?. and then they asked some things about what room i want , they was out of standard rooms ? they said , so i got deluxe room . Deluxe room was very nice , it was wide. And it had its own aircondition. also i think this manboo all their rooms were actual Rooms , not cubicle. you could Lock the door. i payed 3200 yen for the Room , check-in any time between 11am and midnight , check out by 11am next day. notbad imo.

![8.28 13:08 GMT+9: The Room](pics/20230828_130843.jpg)

I took a Look at the facilities , and then i prepared to go to on a [外出](GAISYUTU) (T/N: GAISYUTU means GO OUT). this was challenging because to go on a [外出](GAISYUTU) , you have to present ur receipt/keys to the FRONT, and then they take ur RECEIPT/keys and give u a little card and then u leave and when u come back u give them back ur little card and they give u back ur receipt/keys. the tricky part of this is that u have to GO TO THE FRONT and talk to the person. however, i did it , i think i might have even said [外出](がいしゅつ) to the person real slowly in a manner similar to how i once said [シャワー](shower) , and they gave me the little card and i left.

<div class=aside>
### aside: plot holes
i mentioned before how [シャワー](shower) was the only japanese words i spoke on this trip. however after digging deeper into my memories i think this may not be true. for example, i may have said [外出](GAISYUTU) as described above. and thinking more , i may have even said [終了](SYUURYOU) in the future when indicating my will to check out . perhaps i even said more things in the future. i do not know.
</div>

I went up back around Akihabara station , and i went to i think a [DAISO](like japanese dollar store) inside a [YODOBASHI CAMERA](giant store thing). on the way up to DAISO i browsed the YODOBASHI CAMERA which was a real sensory experience , i also ended up buying some kind of [Shouchuu](焼酎) alcohol at the alcohol section (idk why theres an alcohol section).

<div class=aside>
### aside: purchasing alcohol in japan
in USA when u purchase alcohol , often you must present ur ID to a fellow human to verify that u are above the legal drinking age. some cashier check ur id, some will not.

in Japan i did not present my ID once in all my several times purchasing alcohol. maybe its bc i already looked old or sth idk. At convenience store , there is often a little display on the kiosk asking if ur above the drinking age and u have to press it , but this was the most verification i underwent in my travels. at this YODOBASHI CAMERA alcohol section the person did not do any kind of verification.
</div>

<div class=aside>
### aside: THE MONEY TRAY
in many, most? japanese (and i think other later countries probably) Establishments i have purchased things and Exchanged Money at , there is a little Tray where i have learned you should put ur Money and Payment and things. i learned that this is the function when i visited this YODOBASHI CAMERA alcohol section and payed by first putting a bill on the counter , and the cashier put it in THE TRAY which i only then noticed.
</div>

and then i went to the DAISO and purchased Pocket-monster dining table cleaning wipes, and a coin purse pouch wallet.

![8.28 15:34 GMT+9: a picture i took in-side YODOBASHI CAMERA](pics/20230828_153406.jpg)

![8.28 15:43 GMT+9: i saw this Small Beer can in the alcohol section. it was short and cute.](pics/20230828_154338.jpg)

![8.28 18:34 GMT+9: Pocket-monster dining table cleaning wipes](pics/20230828_183457.jpg)

and then i went to a fast-food place called Matsuya which was suggested by an friend who heard about it or sth . when i went to it i also realised i had passed by several earlier in the day and wondered what it was. I ordered a Packaged Takeaway food; my order was:

- [牛焼肉定食 特盛/プレーン](cow grilled meat set) (JPY 690)
- [焼肉小鉢のりキム](little side dish thing of seaweed and kimchi) (JPY 90)

and also i stopped by convenience store on way back to Lodging to buy an beer.

![8.28 17:13 GMT+9: this picture is probably taken on [和泉橋](IZUMIBASHI) over the [神田川](KANDAGAWA) facing West on my way walking back to Lodging.](pics/20230828_171341.jpg)

I got back to the lodging and took a shower in the Coin Shower , and then it was time to eat!!. I forgot to get utensils at the Matsuya. And i didnt want to ask the Front even though i knew they probably had them (when checking out tomorrow i noticed they had some next to a vending machine in the lobby). So i folded up one of the plastic lids and used it as a spoon kind of to eat my Food.

![8.28 17:58 GMT+9: Food](pics/20230828_175826.jpg)

![8.28 18:35 GMT+9: syoutyuu (JPY 937)](pics/20230828_183550.jpg)

![8.28 20:55 GMT+9: Seven Eleven Suntory beer (JPY 204)](pics/20230828_205512.jpg)

The food was good . The rice was big (i ordered it big) and nice. however the salad i had no dressing for and just ate plain raw vegetables. The Shouchuu i poured into my empty salad bowl to drink. it tasted sort of like something between whiskey and wine. The beer tasted uninspiring very generic beer i think.

I don't really remember what I did for the rest of the night but I assume just brush teeth and go to sleep. END OF DAY 2

![approx my path in akihabara on day 2 japan](pics/japan-2-2.png)

## japan day 3 -- tokyo

in the morning i believe i looked things up on the internet. I looked up a "100-yen locker" where i could store my belongings so i didnt have to carry them around while i walk around. And I ended up booking a whole Hotel , but a "capsule hotel" , in shinjuku. because it was cheap and said it had a bath.

i left room at approx 10:30 and went to the 100-yen locker around [神田駅](kanda station) and put belongings into it.

![8.29 10:45 GMT+9: i passed by this Mexican Food on the way to 100-yen locker, including the [大人気『タコス』](very popular『tacos』)](pics/20230829_104553.jpg)

![8.29 10:55 GMT+9: a picture of area around where i stored items in 100-yen locker. the locker was behind the vending machine.](pics/20230829_105512.jpg)

<div class=aside>
### N-yen lockers
in urban japan i see many temporary lockers that u can put things in , pay , lock, come back to , and unlock, and take stuff. Around train stations and stuff and just on streets.

There are many types of these , vary in Pricing per time, size, what u use to unlock<sup>is there physical key u take? can u unlock and pay using IC card?</sup>, etc.

the one i used was 100 yen for i think..8 hrs?? though i spent 200 yen bc i didnt know u can only unlock it once. you put Coin in it and then u can lock it with the physical Key and the Key comes out and u carry it around and then come back and put the Key back in and unlock it.
</div>

Then i walk a bit around [Kanda](神田) area. I walked into a 'hanamaru udon' shop because i knew the name but didnt know it was an udon chain shop fast food type thing. however it looked like u had to interact heavily with people to get food and i was scared and i simply turned around on the stairs down and left.

i walk up to Akihabara area, and back to the same Matsuya i ate at Yesterday , where i ordered food to eat in the store. i ordered [ネギたま牛めしランチ大盛](green-onion and egg beef rice lunch large portion). it was very tasty. and sit down eat in matsuya u get free miso soup and pickled radish and salad dressing. delicious!.

![8.29 11:28 GMT+9: yum](pics/20230829_112832.jpg)

I then walked around Akihabara. It was nice , there were many Things to look at. As you may not know, akihabara is maybe known for having many Hobby things , and there were indeed many Hobby things , and in general just many small Interesting things to examine. There were many large tall buildings that contain many Shops selling many different Things, and there were Arcades, and there were things. i walked around. and i walked through some streets. it was neat. Also i bought a Bag from the store [無印良品](muji) to hopefully carry things around slightly more comfortablyer than my reusable grocery bag.

![8.29 13:17 GMT+9: model guns i saw in some store](pics/20230829_131720.jpg)

![8.29 13:44 GMT+9: USA Beer i saw in some store](pics/20230829_134434.jpg)

![8.29 13:59 GMT+9: one store i went to had the largest computer keyboard display i had ever seen in my life. Back In My Youth i quite enjoyed being Enthusiastic about Computer Keyboards. Leave A Comment Down below if you like Computer Keyboards.](pics/20230829_135907.jpg)

![8.29 14:19 GMT+9: an alley filled with Capsule Machine things = Gacha = u put coins into machine and turn the knob and u get random Toy from select bunch of things.](pics/20230829_141913.jpg)

![8.29 15:18 GMT+9: i went into an arcade and there was this large plastic box of cup noodles UFO catch/claw? machine game , and i thought: Hmm, i don't really have any use for that. i dont have any use for that plastic box, and i dont really like cup noodles that much i dont think i could eat all of them. But the Box looked knock-overable and it was so Tempting. So i tried the Game, and failed, and tried again, and entered some kind of altered state of mind , a frenzy perhaps, a madness , while i tried like 10 times or so wasted JPY 1000. this was the end result. in other news i pulled a little kirby toy first try and two "umaibo" snacks from other machines.](pics/20230829_151825.jpg)

![8.29 15:34 GMT+9: i saw this cute capsule toy [鳩ハット](hato HATTO) and it was so cute and i wondered should i get one, but i thought , no , i have no desire for material goods . but i still think about this [鳩ハット](hato HATTO) occasionally.](pics/20230829_153401.jpg)

After walking around Akihabara , i took the train one stop back to [神田駅](KANDA STATION), reasoning that since i used a 100-yen locker instead of a more common 300-yen locker , the less-than-200-yen train ticket was covered by the cheapness of the 100-yen locker. I retreived my belongings and then went back to shinjuku , in fact the exact 新大久保駅 that i entered to go to akihabara on day 2, and went to the "capsule hotel" i booked in the morning.

![an approximate map of path i probably took around akihabara on day 3 (i dont remember exactly). green represent TRAIN travel. idk how i trained out of the area (either clockwise or counterclockwise on yamanote line)](pics/japan-3-1.png)

<div class=aside>
### aside: capsule hotel
An 'Capsule Hotel' is a Lodging where ur Bed is a little capsule stacked among other Capsules (other peoples beds). and the bathroom is probably public.
</div>

this was first 'hotel' i stay at. The check-in process was new for me. i think i tried to say sth in Japanese like "[reservation](予約?)" But the employee could tell i had no clue what i was doing and directed me in english to hand over passport and fill out something on a form and put shoes in locker and things.

i looked around and put my stuff in my provided locker. then i went out. i wasnt sure if i was supposed to leave my key at front or something but i didnt and didnt experience any problems.

I decide to go to [Shibuya](渋谷) , one of the places i heard of before coming to Tokyo. I took the train, and got off train. There i crossed a large Scramble Crossing which i assumed was Famous Japanese Scramble Crossing i had heard of before , because it was big, but also because there were tourists taking pictures. After checking map i think It Was.

![8.29 19:10 GMT+9: large scramble crossing](pics/20230829_191041.jpg)

it was getting late and i had not eaten dinner , so i looked around for a place to eat. However, all of the places to eat looked terrifying because u had to interact with people. Even stores where you get a ticket and then go inside and hand to someone (i think?) seemed terrifying. i think i was about to go in some ramen shop following some guy and observing what he did so i could flawlessly operate the machine and copy the Social Script. But then i became afraid and left. I also went into a burger king and tried to order on a Kiosk. It did not accept my credit card. But i kept trying to pay with my credit card. and eventually it just locked the kiosk or something and that was awkward and i walked out of there. Eventually i seeked out a Matsuya, and ordered ate food there.

![8.29 19:49 GMT+9: My Matsuya Order: [麻婆カルビ焼肉定食特盛](MAPO GALBI GRILLED MEAT SET(very large size))](pics/20230829_194919.jpg)

<div class=aside>
### Ordering in [Matsuya](松屋)
matsuya became my safe space in japan. yummy food do not have to talk to someone, only very basic interaction dont need words. terrific! except one time which will come later.

But how does one Order In Matsuya? here i will document the process for You.

1. use the kiosk to order Food. you can pay with Cash or Credit or OTHER FORMS OF payment as well though ive never used them. Some matuyas my foreign credit card simply did not work i have no clue why so i used cash.<sup>i personally would have used cash all the time if my credit card did not charge cash withdrawal fees</sup>
2. The kiosk will Print you some Tickets once u finish Order. Note that if u order multiple things you may get MULTIPLE TICKETS make sure u get all of them :). You can now Sit Down at a Seat, perhaps fetch Water or Tea from the drink Machine probably in the store which is Self.
3. After waiting for a while, the store speaker system will go PIN PON and call ur number in japanese and [_**カウンターへどうぞ**_](カウンターへどうぞ) and also it pops up on the monitors which are mounted in various positions around the store.
4. go to counter and hand person ur ticket(s) and they look at them and rip them and hand u back half of them and then u take ur food and sit down and eat. note: usually they give u appropriate utensils but if u need more , in my experience they are often at counter.
5. eat
6. put ur dishes in the dish return
7. leave

note: this is how i did it and i might have did it wrong
</div>

it was very tasty i become a bit hungry look at picture.

After my meal i went around and walked around. I went into an convenience store and bought an Alcohol, [チャミスル マスカット](chammy sul Muscat), and sour-cream-(and-onion?) pringles. i picked this alcohol because i remember seeing its empty bottles discarded in random places on street so far in my tokyo travels. I drank it while walking around back to train station , it was very sweet and tbh just tasted like uncarbonated grape soda.

![8.29 20:13 GMT+9: the streets of shibuya](pics/20230829_201327.jpg)

I rode back to [Shinookubo](新大久保) and walked back to hotel , along the way in the dark side streets i think i might may have been solicited by someone(s) saying '[兄さん](niisan)' , but i arrived back at hotel and then took a bath

![8.29 20:58 GMT+9: the bath. it felt good , and it was pleasant](pics/20230829_205807.jpg)

the bath felt good and was pleasant. after bath i think i just used phone a short while and went to sleep. the capsule blanket was fluffy and comfy. btw this booking cost USD 23.33 including tax. END OF DAY 3

![approx path i took in second half of JAPAN DAY 3. green represent train. red represent walk.](pics/japan-3-2.png)

## japan day 4 -- tokyo

In the morning I decide to go to Harajuku because that was one of the other three places i heard about in tokyo before coming to tokyo. I thought about trying to find thrift store and buy a pair of pants in order to have Two pairs of pants so i can Wear one pair of pants while Washing the other pair of pants. However i went to Harajuku and found One thrift store but it was not yet open at that time of the day so i kind of just Gave up on finding a thrift store and instead Wandered around.

i do not really remember where i wandered , it was not very memorable. i think i maybe walked through some kind of small park?. At some point I accidentally wandered into "Takeshita street" which seemed to be a major tourist attraction. there were lots of shops n stuff to look at i looked at them. and then i ate at a mcdonalds. my order was

- 1 [BIGMAC](big mac)
- 1 [アップルP](apple pie)
- 1 [ポテトL](large french fries)
- 1 [zzブルーハワイ](blue hawaii drink thing)

![8.30 11:41 GMT+9: my [MCDONALDS](マック) order](pics/20230830_114147.jpg)

![8.30 10:42 GMT+9: unrelated but i passed this earlier , yesterdays traffic accidents statistics.](pics/20230830_104243.jpg)

![8.30 11:54 GMT+9: my [MCDONALDS](マック) apple pie. it seemed a lot more.. fried? than the mcdonalds apple pies i remember once having in USA, though maybe its changed in USA. also i dont think there were holes in this pie whereas USA McApplePie i remember having. LMK Down In the comments Section below what you're are McDonald's Apple Pie Is like.](pics/20230830_115454.jpg)

i finished my Food though took my half-finished Blue Drink and then walked to a nearby Park and found a bench and sat down and poured some [Syoutyuu](焼酎) that i still had in bag to make some kind of cocktail and drank it with eating the SourCream(and onion?) pringles i bought yesterday and an Umaibo that i pulled from an akihabara crane catch thing machine.

![8.30 12:16 GMT+9: snack time](pics/20230830_121641.jpg)

i sat a bit probably snacking and then walked around park and sat at various other locations in the Park. the park looked like a standard Park. there were many Crows i saw.

![8.30 12:36 GMT+9: a crow](pics/20230830_123609.jpg)

![8.30 12:37 GMT+9: a fountain](pics/20230830_123725.jpg)

![8.30 12:41 GMT+9: a small duck swimming apparently alone in fountain lake](pics/20230830_124120.jpg)

Then i walked out the park and then into the shrine thing right next the park.

![8.30 13:10 GMT+9: shrine entrance](pics/20230830_131056.jpg)

![8.30 13:25 GMT+9: i took this picture because once i watched a youtube video about nailless architecture or sth and i assumed this was nailless maybe.](pics/20230830_132517.jpg)

![8.30 13:34 GMT+9: I saw this Dove walking out the Shrine Area](pics/20230830_133441.jpg)

![8.30 13:38 GMT+9: i took this picture bc i had no clue what the funnel things were. after looking it up now i think they are funnel bug traps? lmk in the comments section below if u know.](pics/20230830_133808.jpg)

the shrine was neat i guess. one thing i noticed is that whenever someone walk out a Shrine Gate they turn around , face the shrine, and bow to shrine. i kinda felt awkward and weird doing this but i also felt awkward and weird not doing this, so i did some kind of half-assed version when i felt nobody was around so i would not be forever cursed by Japanese Spirits .

<span class=drop-caps>i was</span> done with harajuku and ready to move on.

![a map of a probable path i maybe took through harajuku.](pics/japan-4-1.png)

To Leave I boarded a train at [Harajuku](原宿), or actually maybe [Yoyogi](代々木) station (i dont remember which). I think I was intending to go to [品川](shinagawa)(?<sup>I think this because I ended up going there. But I actually don't exactly remember if I knew where I was going, and I don't actually know how I decided what ticket to buy</sup>), except i also wanted to visit tokyo station i think?. But anyways I ended up riding from [harajuku](原宿) (or maybe [yoyogi](代々木)) station to [tokyo](東京) station , clockwise on the [yamanote](山手) line. i got off at tokyo station (not leaving the gates) and walked around. i think i searched for wifi and looked stuff up; I don't exactly remember what I looked up, maybe lodging details?

![8.30 15:29 GMT+9: idk why i took this picture but its the only picture i have describing my this train adventure](pics/20230830_152918.jpg)

But eventually I rode (clockwise again) from [Tokyo](東京) to [Shinagawa](品川) and got off. and i believe I was intending to go to a Manboo. But i realised that the manboo I was intending on going to was located in [川口](idk how to pronounce this but notice it looks sort of like 品川), not [品川](shinagawa).

<span class=drop-caps>so i</span> ended up taking train back to [shinookubo](新大久保) for the night.

![A diagram of how i rode the train on the [YAMANOTE](山手) line, Starting at [Harajuku](原宿) ((or maybe actually 代々木)) and ending at [Sinookubo](新大久保). i made a full circle!.](pics/japan-4-yamanote.png)

I walked the street around [sin ookubo](新大久保) , browsed shops and things. i had been in the area before , but seemed still very new to me ; probably did not look very carefully before.

![8.30 17:15 GMT+9: funny duck saying [いらっしゃいませ～](irassyaimase~)](pics/20230830_171553.jpg)

![8.30 17:28 GMT+9: an impressionable scene where sun was sort of beginning to set and it shone through the street](pics/20230830_172820.jpg)

<span class=drop-caps>I Ate Dinner At</span> matsuya ; i had [エッグデミハンバーグ定食特盛](egg demi hamburg set tokumori) ; it was yummy. then i went to DON QUIJOTE and contemplated buying some things , ended up not buying anything. Went to some Convenience stores , eventually bought a shaving Razor from seven-eleven which i think was labeled incorrectly it was more expensive than price listed i believe .

Anyways i then went to Lodge For The Night by going to an Manboo on the street. To get a room i showed the following screen to them I believe:

![8.30 22:06 GMT+9: ](pics/Screenshot_20230830_220620_Chrome.jpg)

and then they walked me through the process i understood like half of what they said and nodded and stuff and paid and got my room. The room was a couch-sofa room ? instead of a flat room like i was used to , maybe i missed something when going through process. This manboo felt a little less nice the other ones i had been to i think , e.g. toilet room smelled not too great , smoke smell was a bit stronger , sink faucet was wobbly , also i just didnt really like the couch-sofa thing. But it was okay . also they had a tenga-cup vending machine in the toilet room which was interesting.

![8.30 20:49 GMT+9: The Room. there is a blanket on the desk which i obtained during the check-in something process when the guy asked if i needed a blanket and i replied affirmatively and held up One finger to indicate i wanted One blanket. I Am Quite Proud Of My Communication Skills. note: the seat thing folds down so u can sleep flat on it.](pics/20230830_204910.jpg)

i believe my night activites included:

- take shower
- sit in front of TV watching japanese television while attempting for first time in my life use a non-electric razor to dry-shave my face without a mirror .
  - i believe<sup>(i think it was this night)</sup> there was a program about making food out of discounted food products from [DONQUIJOTE](donki). it was very entertaining to me in that moment . the content was interesting , but also half of the show was just the reactions from these two people eating the food , and idk how to describe it but the reactions were so fake but also so real but also sort of like self-aware and yet a commentary on the social script of needing to produce positive and interesting reactions. it felt like the reactions were overblown yet everyone knew that and everyone knew they were just following the script Yet they were still having fun and they knew that everyone else know it was just the Social Script. it was interesting.
- This night i received a formal Offer Letter of Employment from my Potential Employer. i was expecting it and it finally arrived That Night. It was nice to Finally Receive Employment Offer , but there was a troublesome bit of news : which was i had to Take A Drug Test. if you wish to read about this you may read about it in the below Aside.

Anyways at some point i went to sleep. END OF DAY 4

![A general Path i probably approximately took through [Sinookubo](新大久保) on Day 4. note i just walked the same street road thing.](pics/japan-4-2.png)

<div class=aside>
### aside: accepting USA employment offer while homeless in japan
So actually I booked my plane to Japan while in a potential-employment situation with an Employer, which was approx this: the employer said "we want to offer you employment but we have to do 300 paperwork and stuff so we will give u an offer letters and details soon." And i said OK, and then flew to japan (Aug 26), expecting that i can handle employment acceptance things in Asia and come back to USA around Sep 23 to start employment (i think Recruiter said to me that i would probably start around sep 25).

the employment Offer Letter finally came this night , and it had at least two concerning things:

1. it contained the words "As agreed, your first day will be 09/18/2023!". excuse me brother i did not agree to that i did not even hear about that
2. it said i had to complete a Background Check, and within two days after filling out the Background Check i had to take a Drug Test. And the Drug Test was with companies that seemed to only operate in the USA.

i was quite stressed thinking im gonna have to book a plane back to USA in next few days potentially. i emailed recruiter , and phone called them , And essentially they say: We can do background check later. But i was in a mindset where if i dont get this background check done ASAP they are gonna revoke employment offer or something or ill be shunned from the workplace idk. So i replied umm i can probably fly back this weekend. But recruiter said well ok ill check back with u next week if u arent in usa thats fine we can delay background check. and i said ok.

And then i consult with parents , and surprisingly my Father, despite sending me novels of Concerned Texts concerning my employment throughout my trip , seemed to say that it would be better to finish my trip in East Asia. i interpret my father as the type of person to suggest that you sacrifice ur life to climb corporate ladder, so it was strange that he did not suggest that i come back to usa asap. Maybe because he wanted me to come to Taiwan or something.

![9.1 16:34 GMT+9: an example of a concerned-about-my-employment Text sent by my father, ended with "Enjoy the beach!"](pics/Screenshot_20230901_163436_LINE-modified.jpg)

so the next day after Receiving the Letter i decided that i Did want to come back around 9/25, when i originally expected to come home. so i sent email saying can i do background check Then pls. and they didnt respond. so i bumped email. and they respond oop mb ill check with People. and then no response for a few days bc weekend and "labor day" holiday , and then finally got a response: yes that date is ok. hooray!
</div>

## japan day 5 -- yokohama

This day i woke up and went to sinookubo Matsuya to eat midday meal . however there was a person that was kind of taking a long time and i felt awkward just standing there so i left. I had decided to go to [Yokohama](横浜) , because i had roughly heard of its name before, and i also looked up they have a China-town there which sounded interesting to go to. So i took Train to i believe [Yokohama Station](横浜駅), and then walked to a matsuya There to eat my mid-day meal.

<div class=aside>
### aside: timing train rides
from this day onwards i started sometimes timing train rides i took by taking a picture of my ticket (which has a time printed on it) once i arrived at my destination station. and then i just compare the time printed on ticket with timestamp of photo i took.

in this case , i took a train from [shinagawa](品川) to [yokohama](横浜) ; the time printed on the ticket i got at [shinagawa](品川) was 11:46 , and the photo timestamp is 12:12. For a difference of 26 mins. in the future i will use the notation [品川](11:46) [→](26) [横浜](12:12) to Indicate This.

![8.31 13:05 GMT+9: i got the [ランチ牛めし特盛生野菜半熟玉子セット](lunch cow rice very big fresh vegetables half-cooked egg set). i personally do not know what the [生野菜](fresh? vegetable) indicates in the name bc i dont remember any vegetables in there](pics/20230831_130531.jpg)

ordering at this matsuya was an Experience for me. first i went in to order at kiosk, the kiosk dont accept my credit card. At this point in trip i had realised that my credit card charges Fee for cash withdrawals so i wanted to Not Use Cash where i could. I saw that the kiosk accepted other form of payments?so i left store to look up things , but either i couldnt get wifi or i just gave up. I go to reenter then someone else was using kiosk so i paced around outside bc it felt awkward to enter and just stand in store. When they done i go use kiosk about to pay for stuff , but then was adjusting order or sth and then Worker came over to me and talking to me (in japanese) about like theres coupon or sth do u want to use? ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm , i replied affirmatively or sth and then they pressed some things and then asked me to enter sth and then i wondered ohhh did i need to have a coupon?i thought they were just giving me a coupon. so then i replied negatively or sth i think and then they were like ummmmmmmmm oh..ok? uhh , well are u ok with this order? and i replied affirmatively and and they say how u wanna pay and i press cash or sth and they say [キャッシュ](cash) and my tickets and change come out and i think they prob gesture to my ticket and then they leave, but only before giving me the deepest bow , 90 degree bow , i had ever received  ,  tbh i was shook ; frazzled ; confused , however it was over . and i sat at counter booth and continued my matsuya experience. i still wonder what they were thinking dealing with that Silent and Confusing customer.

<div class=aside>
### tomato juice
i got a can of tomato juice from a Vending Machine and drank some of it as i walked to the matsuya. and drank rest of it with my meal. it would be weird to dispose of it by putting it on my tray and having matsuya dispose of it, i thought. so i just put the empty can in my pocket while returning my tray and then disposed it in a can disposal sometime later somewhere idk where.
</div>

Then i walk back to Station and took a train to the Chinatown.

![8.31 13:44 GMT+9: train sign](pics/20230831_134431.jpg)

![8.31 13:56 GMT+9: train](pics/20230831_135632.jpg)

chinatown was cool ig , it felt mostly just like neat tourist attraction. so i looked at things walked around, and then left.

![8.31 14:23 GMT+9: chinatown2](pics/20230831_142310.jpg)

I entered a nearby Park that had Trees and a Body Of Water. And i sat on a bench. There were a large gathering of Pigeons. Some Pigeons were cleaning each other or some thing, which is first time i had seen that behavior. Also many pigeons were Loafing around i.e. Resting in a shape similar to a Loaf Of Bread on the Ground. this was Epic and they were Cute and i took Pictures.

![8.31 14:38 GMT+9: Loaf](pics/20230831_143847.jpg)

![8.31 14:44 GMT+9: Loaf](pics/20230831_144456.jpg)

![8.31 15:03 GMT+9: though there are not very visible, there are Pigeons in this tree i think.](pics/20230831_150318.jpg)

![8.31 15:08 GMT+9: Loaf](pics/20230831_150815.jpg)

i sat in the park for a while. i was a bit tired. then i got up and walked to another park located by a Harbour or Port or something ; it was neat to see a Large Body of Water.

![8.31 15:51 GMT+9: large body of water](pics/20230831_155153.jpg)

i walked around along a Walkway built along the Waterside or so and looked at Things. once i passed this festival something and they were having a performance and it was neat , though i did not take pictures bc there were ppl holding signs and telling ppl not to photography.

![8.31 15:59 GMT+9: walkway](pics/20230831_155937.jpg)

![8.31 17:13 GMT+9: a wheel](pics/20230831_171321.jpg)

![8.31 17:16 GMT+9: grass and the wheel](pics/20230831_171652.jpg)

![8.31 17:22 GMT+9: boat](pics/20230831_172257.jpg)

While i was walking, I thought: maybe i should take a Ferry to somewhere. because there was a Harbour Port thing right here, and i wondered if i Could take a ferry somewhere. I think i was inspired by that Suzume Japanese Animation i watched on the plane to Japan , in which they Took a Ferry. But after looking things up , I concluded idk what i was doing, so i did not take a Ferry.

I walked to an [無印良品](muji) Store because i have formed a deep trust and emotional connection with the stores, and i bought a pair of Short Pants which was on sale i believe. Then i walked over to an Manboo in order to lodge in for the night , stopping by a Convenience store along the way to buy Food to Eat for Dinner. Also i stopped by a Vending machine and bought a JPY-100 drink with a JPY-1000 bill in order to get some JPY-100 coins. iirc it gave my change entirely in JPY-100 coins which was great, but i thought i pressed a Water-Bottle button but it gave me some kind of Lemon Drink.

![8.31 17:50 GMT+9: Yokohama Smoking Area](pics/20230831_175049.jpg)

![8.31 17:54 GMT+9: Yokohama Road](pics/20230831_175402.jpg)

![8.31 18:05 GMT+9: Yokohama Street](pics/20230831_180511.jpg)

Anyways i entered the Manboo and showed them my Phone Screen asking pls give me room. they walked me through process , in japanese i think , they were giving me like a briefing of the rules and how everything works i think ; i remember they asked me '[吸いますか](does u smoke)' and i replied negatively n stuff. and then came the Payment or so and then i handed them my membership and then they was like ohh u have the membership card lol , and then they gave me a receipt which was only JPY200 for 30 mins and i dont actually pay then. That confused me until i reread the prices sheet and at the top it says (for members) it automatically charges the cheapest price (when u check out i guess). That was interesting bc all the other manboo i went to i just payed upfront , even though i think their price sheets also had this automatic pricing thing (myb because i explicitly asked for the package).

![8.31 23:12 GMT+9: my phone screen. note i took this screenshot later than actually i showed them.](pics/Screenshot_20230831_231236_Chrome.jpg)

anyways i went to room and then showered with Coin Shower and then put on my Newly Bought pants and go do laundry with Coin Laundry (there was a Coin Laundry in this Manboo). i attempted to read the coin-laundry instructions bc it seemed u needed to? could? run some kind of cleaning cycle beforehand? or something? but i had no clue ; i put coins in and it just started filling drum with water (and probably displayed a timer?) so i just threw all my laundry in and left.

While laundry was going i put hot water in my Cup Noodles using a hot-water dispenser , which i think was my first time using one of them , and i was confused there was a 'lock' or something? i just pressed things and eventually it worked. I was going to eat them but then i was sort of confused because i passed a counter that said sth like 'please enjoy the food that we sell here', and i was confused : did that mean i shouldnt eat in my own room? i decided just eat in my room bc i assumed I Could.

![8.31 19:31 GMT+9: Dinner](pics/20230831_193146.jpg)

finished dinner , went to laundry , it seemed to be washed. i put it in Drier. In My Room as clothing was drying i am not sure what i did. i think i drank some [Shoutyuu](焼酎) that i was still carrying around , in order to lighten my Bag of Stuff (this is not a good reason for drinking alcohol, probably). also probably drank some Lemon Drink i accidentally got from vending machine. And i think i was thinking about , looking up things What To Do Where To Go Tomorrow?. I remember retrieving my Laundry from Drier, then probably continuing Sitting In My Room.

I think i looked up something about japan trains and was thinking about Travelling West in Japan. I wrote in my Notes: "i think im want to wake up at early then train across japan maybe." But at some point i accidentally fell asleep, probably because i was tired and also drowsy from ingesting Alcohol. END OF day 5

![approx path i took through YOKOHAMA on day 5 japan.](pics/japan-5-yokohama.png)

## japan day 6 -- atami, fuji

I woke up around 2AM and realised i had accidentally fallen asleep. i brushed my teeth , went back to sleep. Then woke up again around 5AM and booked a hotel that was "cheap and didnt look too bad and was in middleish of yokohama and [nagoya/kansai](west places in Japan) and was near [mount fuji](Mountain) and named seem strangely familiar idk" (quote by me writing in my notes in the evening).

I checked out at exactly 6:29AM. And i checked in at exactly 6:30PM the day before , and so i was charged for the 12HR pack (instead of the 15HR pack i assume?<sup>though i actually don't know how the pricing exactly works. Would i be charged the 12HR pack + some extra minutes? LMK in the comments section if u know how Manboo Pricing System Works :)</sup>). So it cost only JPY 2000 (instead of potentially 2500). Hooray!

I ate a Morning Meal at a nearby Matsuya. i always wanted to have a Breakfast Set thing at matsuya so i Did. It was tasty and only cost JPY500 nice!.

![9.1 07:02 GMT+9: yummy matuya breakfast](pics/20230901_070249.jpg)

i walked to the nearby JR-EAST [関内駅](kannai station). I was not completely sure what Trains i could take West. However i read online or something you could just take "local trains" completely to [Oosaka](Famous Big Urban Area West Of Here) ("local" meaning umm Normal, not high-speed trains. Just like Trains that transport u around a city. except it transports u Between cities.) So, I bought the highest-value ticket available, and then i Boarded a Train Intending to go to the farthest-west station listed on the Fare Map that seemed to be connected The West of japan (i.e. [沼津](numadu)).

![9.1 07:41 GMT+9: the Fare Map i looked at](pics/20230901_074141.jpg)

I rode The Train. On The train, i was looking at the Map and stuff, and i saw i would go through a station called [熱海](atami), which sounded Enticing. chinese character mean like Hot Sea? Scorched Sea? warm sea?? idk but it sounded cool, esp because i like Beaches, and i saw they had a Beaches.

I think the train i was riding stopped at [Atami](熱海) so i had to get off and transfer to another westward train. But i was too enticed and so i left the gates (wasting JPY350 in fare) to walk around. I visited a Beach which felt like the most artificial man-made beach ever created

![9.1 10:45 GMT+9: beach pic](pics/20230901_104547.jpg)

![9.1 11:00 GMT+9: beach pic](pics/20230901_110022.jpg)

![9.1 11:01 GMT+9: beach pic](pics/20230901_110157.jpg)

It had some kind of barriers so the water was very calm which i personally was not a big fan of. It also a vending machine with the most expensive pocari sweat i had seen in ; most pocari i saw in vending machines was JPY 170~180; this pocari was above 200. which was interesting because i think it was first time i had seen that much difference in typical vending machine prices (all were about the same).

<div class=aside>
### vending machine prices in japan
whenever i passed by a vending machine in japan i usually looked at the prices and selection. i have concluded that vending machine prices are remarkably uniform across Where I Went, including more rural places. Sometimes some areas may have Cheap Machines selling stuff at like JPY100, 110, but this is because they are selling their own (cheaper) drinks. If u look at the price of sth like: Coca Cola, i think it does not vary much beyond like 1, 2, 3 tens of cents across all the areas i visited. As a side-note, drinks at JPY100 were generally rare, and i encountered probably less than 10 total machines ever selling drinks below JPY100.
</div>

However, the beach was ok and perhaps even nice. because it was a beach i like beaches. I soon left the beach and walked back to the station

![9.1 11:08 GMT+9: picture i took walking back to station](pics/20230901_110835.jpg)

![9.1 11:12 GMT+9: picture i took walking back to station](pics/20230901_111214.jpg)

And then i boarded westward train. its final stop was at a station where i had to get off and transfer to another westward train.

<div class=aside>
### different train carriages seating
on my westward train journey i discovered that sometimes a train has different Train Carriage Types, and that you can Pay to ride a more comfy Seats or something. I believe the stations will mark Where these carriages will stop, but i did not see these markings. so i accidentally got on one once.

There are also regular commuter-style carriages which are the standard seats-lining-wall. There are also sometimes front/back facing seats , which u can switch to face Front/Back by pulling it up.

![heres a picture of front/back facing seats. And also handles u can Pull Up to switch their front/back orientation i think.](pics/20230902_144911.jpg)

Often there will be seats that end up facing each other , a very awkward configuration in which there are technically Four seats but its kinda weird to sit Directly Across from someone or Right Next to them so u have one person sit in one corner and the other person sits in the diagonally-opposite corner.

![heres a picture of the awkward Seat Setup where two seats are facing another Two seats. I am sitting in one Seat facing the other Two Seats.](pics/20230902_200920.jpg)
</div>

![9.1 12:33 GMT+9: at nuzumu station waiting for another westward train](pics/20230901_123342.jpg)

Eventually i arrived at [吉原](YOSHIWARA) station ([熱海](11:54) [->](57) [吉原](12:51)) where I got off and then walked towards a [無印良品](muji) Store intending to buy a backpack. i walked through some kind of industrial area for a little more than an hour to get to The Store; it was definitely New Scenery. There was really Nobody There except me and Passing-By Cars and People working in Industrial Building Things.

![9.1 13:22 GMT+9: Fuji Mountain (i think). this area is near Fuji Mountain, so i was able to see Fuji Mountain (when it was not obscured by buildings).](pics/20230901_132209.jpg)

![9.1 13:38 GMT+9: a train crossing the road](pics/20230901_133814.jpg)

The Store was in a small little shopping center with large parking lot ; i could feel , tell that i was not in large city. I went in the Store bought a backpack , and a little organizing pouch thing. I took my purchases out the store and squatted in the Shopping Center Storefront organizing my Belongings into the Backpack and stuff.

Once i was done, i set off to my Hotel i booked in the morning. I could have taken a train at nearby train station, but i decided to save a few hundred JPY and also see more of the area by Walking. I walked for quite a while , like 2 hours. headed in wrong direction a few times , observed the scenery and Looked at Things.

![9.1 14:36 GMT+9: water with green in it](pics/20230901_143652.jpg)

![9.1 16:02 GMT+9: this seemed to be some sort of "downtown(?)" area with many businesses in a dense area.](pics/20230901_160221.jpg)

Eventually i arrived at the Hotel and i checked in. check-in procedure was essentially

1. say something unintelligible so employee knows idk what im doing
2. they asked "check in?" probably
3. give them passport , and they make a photocopy (idk why but all japanese hotel things ive been to do this i think)
4. fill out some stuff on form they want
5. they give key. this marks end of check-in procedure

Here is my room:

![9.1 17:18 GMT+9: room](pics/20230901_171834.jpg)

![9.1 17:18 GMT+9: bathroom](pics/20230901_171842.jpg)

i remember it as being OK. in my notes i wrote that it was "kinda musty". i sat in hotel room a bit charging my phone and writing a follow-up email to Employment Recruiter person that had not responded to my email. Then i went out to walk around Town and find Dinner.

![9.1 17:29 GMT+9: "downtown" area sun about to set](pics/20230901_172939.jpg)

![9.1 17:32 GMT+9: random street](pics/20230901_173234.jpg)

I end up go to an convenience store, a Lawson. I bought a Big cup noodle, a hamburg steak Lunch Box, and a 2L bottle of water. I was slightly anxieteous because this was first time going to a Lawson, esp one outside a big city. However there was nothing out of the ordinary and i think the only interaction i had to do was reply negatively to Do You Need A Bag or so.

![9.1 17:56 GMT+9: picture](pics/20230901_175644.jpg)

I went back to hotel , i bought a suntory 'highball' from an alcohol vending machine in the hotel lobby (JPY 200). I took a bath , it felt very nice , and they provided a 'bath sponge' , so i could Exfoliate mine skin well. It Was Now Dinner time!!!!!

![9.1 18:51 GMT+9: meal setup. Cup noodle, Lunchbox (hamburg sauce not applied yet)](pics/20230901_185127.jpg)

![9.1 18:56 GMT+9: cup noodle (note: hotel hasd boil-water kettle)](pics/20230901_185652.jpg)

the dinner was yummy. the "suntory high ball" i got from hotel lobby I was not a big fan of , it tasted like whiskey mixed with some kind of sweet beverage. also i drank some leftover lemon drink i got on accident in yokohama that i poured my leftover [syoutyuu](焼酎) in.

idk when but i remember i accidentally fell into a little (probably alcohol-induced) nap , likely while Watching the Television. but i woke up, brush teeth and things, went to sleep. END OF DAY 6

![heres a map describing how i took the train hopefully. i believe i traveled along mostly some kind of JR 'tokaido line'.](pics/japan-6-train.png)

![a map describing my rough path i took through area around fuji city. i didnt draw a map of where i went in [atami](熱海) bc i only remember The Beach and thats not detailed enough to draw a path that is any more than just a straight line](pics/japan-6-fuji.png)

## 7: shizuoka,nagoya,gifu

This day i got up and then booked some kind of Hotel around [Nagoya](名古屋), the city which i planned to Go To by the end of the day. Then i checked out hotel. To check out i just dropped key in a Box at the Front , which felt weird bc i thought i would need to talk to someone but I think that was all i needed to do i guess. i dont think there was anyone at desk.

My hotel was like 10 Meter away from the train station so i think i just took train as soon as left hotel. I decided to go to [SHIZUOKA](静岡). Why? I think i looked at google maps and seemed to be a large Settlement between Me and [Nagoya](名古屋) (the place i plan to visit at end of day). Also i was watching Television yesterday and one of the channels was named "TV Shizuoka" or something, so i assumed it was some sort of Representative Of This Area<sup>now that i look it up, Shizuoka is the Capital City of the Region (called Shizuoka), however it is only its Second-Most-Populous city. oops!</sup>. So, i rode the train to [Shizuoka](静岡) ([富士](10:00) [->](80) [静岡](11:20)).

![9.2 10:12 GMT+9: this is a freight train i saw passing through Station. it was fascinating to me bc i had never seen a freight train passing through a Train Station before. probably because ive been to like 2 train stations outside of japan that are not just within-city commuter metro line things.](pics/20230902_101225.jpg)

In shizuoka, my plan was to Walk to a matsuya to Eat my midday meal , enjoying any Scenery and Things i passed by. I passed through a Park which was scenic i guess. But when i arrived at the Matsuya I was scared by

1. there was a parking lot (idk why , but this felt off-putting. maybe because none other matsuya i had been to had a parking lot.)
2. The restaurant layout seemed to be a sort of open-air Counter thing like u might see at a Ramen shop. in other words there is Someone right in front of u doing things as u Eat your Meal probably.

So i did not go in. I walked back to Station and ordered McDonalds and ate McDonalds.

![9.2 11:38 GMT+9: park i passed through](pics/20230902_113805.jpg)

![9.2 11:46 GMT+9: a picture i took](pics/20230902_114640.jpg)

my mcdonalds order was

- 1 Spicy Bacon Potato Pie (JPY 180)
- 1 Chicken Filet-O® (JPY 380)
- 1 Spicy Beef Burger (JPY 220)
- 1 McFry (M) (JPY 330)

![9.2 12:06 GMT+9: chicken](pics/20230902_120622.jpg)

![9.2 12:08 GMT+9: potato pie](pics/20230902_120806.jpg)

![9.2 12:09 GMT+9: beef](pics/20230902_120912.jpg)

And then i just left Shizuoka, idrk why i didnt stay longer , maybe bc already past midday and i wanted to have time to look around Nagoya or sth? In retrospect, i think i should have walked North of Shizuoka Station bc on Google Maps there seems to be many interesting Things there.

![my Entire Trip in the Entirety of Shizuoka, Graphed on Map](pics/japan-7-sizuoka.png)

Anyways i took the train to [Nagoya](名古屋) ([静岡](12:39) [->](187) [名古屋](15:46)), which took kind of a while (it was long distance and involved a transfer or two). For a bit i had the intention to visit some kind of Sand Dunes in [HAMAMATU](浜松)(?), but then looking on the map i realised there was no train there , walking was likely infeasable, and i would have to take Bus or sth which i was too scared to do. So i just continued on to Nagoya.

According to photo timestamps, i (probably) arrived in [Nagoya](名古屋) around 15:46, but i think i only made it out the Station Gates around 16:15. Why? i had a JPY-1340 ticket from [Shizuoka](静岡) Which was not enough money worth to go from shizuoka to [Nagoya](名古屋). If you go through Gate with that ticket at Nagoya it will go BEEEE dont let u through give u back ur ticket. So i take it to the "Fare Adjustment" machine to pay the difference. However It Didnt Work for me. it say sorry cant do this bro, please take to station attendant. However i really did not want to take it to a station attendant. so i just walked around the inner station for a while and tried another fare machine (it didnt work) and watched People passing by for a bit. Until i finally Just Went and Took it to station attendant, saying the words (in english) "Fare Adjustment". The station guy then said the words "静岡" and then appeared to do some Calculations and stuff, and then showed me a calculator with a Number. And i payed the number in JPY (i think it was 2000Some money, though don't exactly remember) , and left (there was no receipt or anything i just handed over the money).

![9.2 14:50 GMT+9: me on the Train waiting at a Station for my Transfer Train to depart (im the 14:50 train to 大垣 that u can see on the screen i believe)](pics/20230902_145042.jpg)

![9.2 15:46 GMT+9: i think i took this picture at Nagoya Station when i arrived.](pics/20230902_154647.jpg)

After i got out of Nagoya Station i dont think i had any particular Plans , i just walked around and looked at things. browsed a [DONQUIJOTE](Donkey) i believe. Went to a very narrow Park thing which had a large Tower thing. Once when walking on the Road Sidewalk thing, i saw a guy holding a Sign looked like he was Soliciting Business for something. I did not want to potentially interact, so I turned to cross the Street instead of continuing Straight. but they WALKED UP TO ME and i was shooked . i assumed a Negative Posture like shook my head no thanks or something body language. But then they pointed to a brochure sticking out of my backpack side pocket and said (in japanese) did u go to tokyo? and then i replied (internally) oh yeah haha By using body language that was probably something like Nodding. They replied sth like "how was it?" and i replied sth like Thumbs Up and Smile. And they said sth like "I'm (from) Gifu". And tbh i would have not known what they was saying except that in the morning i booked my Hotel thing in Gifu (place near Nagoya) so i knew the name. So i tried to communicate "ohhhh!!" in body language which was probably sth like making an "ohhhh!!" facial expression and nodding in recognition. And then they finished the 'conversation' with sth like "make sure to visit one day, hehe". and i nodded probably. And then they left. Overall it was a very Wholesome interaction (at least for me) and i will remember u Gifu Guy thx!!.

<div class=aside>
### aside: solicitors in Japan

in Japan there is often people in Streets holding Flyers or similar thing trying to Solicit people. In my experience these Solicitors are Quite Intense. Here is Two experience i Have with them that Make me Think so.

1. in Akihabara there is many Solicitors dressed in Interesting Costumes ; I Try to Avoid , however once i passed One in which it would be kind of Too Obvious that i was Avoiding them , so i simply Took the flyer because i feel bad for declining Fliers , and i think There is Not Much Trouble for Taking someone's Flyers (i once tried handing out Fliers at mine University , and it was always Pleasanter Than Not when someone Took a flier). However once i Took the flier (idk if i even took the flier ; i might have just Reached Out for the flier) , the person Initiated Dialogue, which initiated my Flight or Flight response. and my mental state was '0:' while i sort of tried to continue Walking , but then the person continued Dialogue , asking "where are u going" (in japanese) , idk if this was a "where are u going? i am curious hehe because i am making conversation" or a "excuse me where are u going u were accepting my Flier , please interact with me in regards to my related Business". In order to Escape this Situation, i Continually used Body language indicating "Good Bye" and Furthered the Distance between myself and Them in the Direction i was Heading , until it appeared they had Let me Go.
2. in [SinOokubo](新大久保) , there was someone Passing out Fliers on kind of a narrow Sidewalk so i just Took the flier bc it felt Natural to. I guess i did not learn from Akihabara, or i just assumed that Akihabara Solicitors were Built Different. However This Solicitor As Well Initiated Dialogue and then somehow got me to Step into the Establishment which was like some kind of Art Showroom and then they were Dialoguing me and i dont remember what they said ; i dont think i understood most of what they said , and they figured this out , and then they asked me (in english i think) Where are u From or sth and i used the same technique of Good-Bye body language while Leaving to Eventually Leave.

in summary, dont take the flier unless u are Actually Interested in Japan. maybe the solicitors are not "intense" so much as They Think U Actually Are Interested So Why would you Just Take Flier then Walk Away. this is my Thoughts.

After Walking Around and Seeing Things i ate at Matsuya (i planned my Walking Around so that i would pass by an Matsuya on the way back to Station)

![9.2 19:09 GMT+9: Matuya Order , an basic 牛めし大.](pics/20230902_190957.jpg)

Then i walk back to Station and Take a Trains to Hotel location.

![9.2 20:27 GMT+9: in honor of Gifu Guy i took a picture of Gifu Sign ; Gifu Station i waited for a Transfer i think.](pics/20230902_202710.jpg)

I eventually got off at the JR '[大垣](OOGAKI)' station . I could have gotten closer to my Hotel location by then taking an local train Which had a really Cute Ticket Machine with Physical Buttons i think. But I would have only rode One Stop and payed JPY 210 so i just decided to Take A Walk.

![9.2 21:49 GMT+9: Water](pics/20230902_214952.jpg)

Eventually i arrived at my Hotel which was not really "Hotel" in typical Large High Rise Run By Large Corporation , it was more kind of like Someone turned their House into a Place u can Stay. In fact they marketed themselves as "[ryokan](旅館)" i believe which tbh idk what that is but translating it says "Japanese Inn".

When i arrive, it is nobody There, only a Front Desk. So i just stood around for a while. and looked around. And nobody come. So i went outside and looked at Outside. And then Came back in and Stood around for a bit more. And eventually a Guy came out some Hallway and asked sth like "are u ジェームズファング様" and i Affirmed and they led me into some Kitchen and they led me to a Table and pulled out a Chair and gestured (and maybe Told?) me to sit so i Sat and looked around while i think they went in the back and got some stuff . Oh they also asked me um "did you walk here?" (first in Japanese but i didnt understand so then they said in english sth like "Walk"). And i affirmed and then they gave me a Sweet Muscat Sparkling beverage as Service.

The vibe was quite interesting , sort of like i was about to get a Firm Talking-To by an Friendly Uncle or something (the person looked like a Friendly Uncle). And then they brought over to me umm i think like my reservation information printed on paper or something? and then sort of showed me things? and maybe asked me things? i remember once they asked me sth like "[旅行ですか](R u on trip)" , and i was confused bc i could not comprehend [旅行](ryoKou) , and then they said sth like [難しいね](this is difficult ne) while fetching a pen from the back room , came back , and then wrote the characters 旅 行 on the paper (ig they assumed i was Chinese and so could read the Characters). Idk if i actually knew the characters, but i understood it more than Verbal, and i sort of understood and/or inferred, and then Affirmed. then they asked for my passport and to make a copy of it so i handed it over and then they come back , give me my key and show me around the Inn , showing where my room, shower, toilets were. And so ended the check-in process.

![9.2 21:53 GMT+9: they Calligraphed many of the Signs they hung around the Inn. very cool!](pics/20230902_215350.jpg)

![9.2 22:04 GMT+9: This was my Room. Very Cute and Cozy!](pics/20230902_220410.jpg)

![9.2 22:04 GMT+9: Muscat Sparkling drink they Give me as Service](pics/20230902_220435.jpg)

I went down(stairs) and took a shower . I also purchased Drank a can of Asahi-Super-Dry Beer from one of they Vending machines for JPY 300. My further night-time activites probably included

- Turn on TV and watching a few mins and turning it off
- Charge phone
- Talk to mother a bit over Phone Call
- Book plane ticket to Taiwan
- Use bathroom
- Brush teeth
- Write notes about Day using Phone application

eventually i Went to Sleep. END OF DAY 7

<div class=aside>
### aside: Lodging prices
in my Travels in Japan , i tended to judge Pricing for Lodging like this:

- JPY 2000: cheap
- JPY 3000: OK, though i wish i could book something like JPY2500 instead.
- JPY 4000: umm
- JPY 5000: expensive

and I tended use the Rough Conversion of JPY100 = USD 1 when Judging Prices, so JPY 100 "felt" like USD1 (even though i knew it was slightly Under USD1). Staying in InternetCafe (Manboo) for first part of trip, i was used to paying approx 2-3k JPY per night. And when i started Booking Hotels, i found that you could usually find Cheap Hotels only Slightly More Expensive, i think around 3-4k (if u book on the same day) (Varies by Region, a lot) (Weekends seem to be More Expensive).

According to my Records, This Night's stay was the Most expensive, costing JPY5067 = USD36.55 . however Retrospectively in the context of This Trip i think it was worth it bc it was Not Just Another Large Chain Hotel Thing That Is About Same As Every Other Hotel; it was more Japanese Style Cute Room and Friendly Uncle Guy.

I probably could have stayed in Cheaper Lodgings if i had stayed in Guesthouse Thing where multiple people sleep in same room, but i was too scared to try those .
</div>

## day 8 -- [米原](maibara),[京都](kyoto)

I woke up , visited the Sink and stuff, and then gathered my Things and Left the Hotel, leaving my Key at the Front Desk (next to someone else's)

![9.3 09:25 GMT+9: i took this picture of the Ceiling of my room](pics/20230903_092529.jpg)

![9.3 09:30 GMT+9: my key on the Front Desk next to Someone Else's](pics/20230903_093053.jpg)

I Walk out the Hotel heading back towards Where i came from , the Friendly Uncle Guy come out and Communicate me some kind of Farewell greetings and also inform me that there is Bus Stop nearby if wish to take it.

I continued walking. I passed the Smaller Local-Train (西大垣駅) Station that i was intending to Ride back to the JR station. However from a brief Scan of the station , it seemed that there were No Automatic Gates , but instead a Human that would Check Tickets??. so i did not take the train , instead Walking back to the JR station.

![9.3 09:33 GMT+9: some kind of Park?](pics/20230903_093344.jpg)

![9.3 09:35 GMT+9: scenery](pics/20230903_093509.jpg)

![9.3 09:54 GMT+9: Parking Lot](pics/20230903_095413.jpg)

![9.3 10:14 GMT+9: Street](pics/20230903_101415.jpg)

I arrived at the Station and Bought a Ticket enough to go to "[Maibara](米原)", because the name sounded chill and also on the map it looked interesting , near a large Lake.

![9.3 10:54 GMT+9: A View out the train window](pics/20230903_105447.webm)

I got to [Maibara](米原) and then planned that i would walk to the nearby Lake , stopping by a Convenience store to buy some Food , then eat my Food at the Lake. I then executed this Plan.

![9.3 11:38 GMT+9: Street Road thing i walked along towards Lake](pics/20230903_113858.jpg)

![9.3 11:53 GMT+9: the seven-eleven in the picture is where i bought my Food i think(?)](pics/20230903_115357.jpg)

![9.3 12:17 GMT+9: near the Lake](pics/20230903_121738.jpg)

i walked a bit along the Road to find an accesspoint to a nice Spot along the Lake Shore. eventually i found a Spot and sat on some kind of concrete Block that was there.

![9.3 12:35 GMT+9: the Spot](pics/20230903_123536.jpg)

Then i enjoyed my Food, and the Lake by Looking at it and Wading In A Little.

![9.3 12:22 GMT+9: my Food from the Convenience. two Rice Balls, one Sand(wich), an Beer which interestingly you Peeled Open to have Large Hole (instead of just a Tab open Little Hole), and Muscat Sparkling that Friendly Uncle gave me i didnt finish.](pics/20230903_122240.jpg)

![9.3 12:26 GMT+9: Lake Shore](pics/20230903_122633.jpg)

![9.3 12:37 GMT+9: Lake Waters. My mother has scared me into fearing that i will Die From Brain-Eating Microorganism if i go into Freshwater Body Of Water. however i only waded with my Feet and sometimes put my Hands in so i was less scared.](pics/20230903_123738.jpg)

![9.3 12:51 GMT+9: Lake and Sky](pics/20230903_125123.jpg)

I Finish Food Leave, walk back to Station. I took a little Detour through some Fields to look at the Scenery.

![9.3 13:05 GMT+9: scenery](pics/20230903_130502.jpg)

![9.3 13:08 GMT+9: Scenery](pics/20230903_130842.jpg)

![9.3 13:38 GMT+9: a Vertical picture showing half-harvested Grains(?)](pics/20230903_133855.jpg)

I made it back to the Station and took Train to Kyoto.

![maibara paths. idrk where i sat on shore, and idrk exact path i took through fields and back to station. actually idrk most of path.](pics/japan-8-maibara.png)

![9.3 15:39 GMT+9: i think i took this picture in Kyoto Station. idk when i left Maibara bc i didnt take a picture of my ticket.](pics/20230903_153936.jpg)

in Kyoto i do not remember having any particular Plans. i ended up going to an Old Building area (i believe it was a temple..?). I remember that it felt very Comfortable and Relieving to my Feet to walk Barefoot(with socks) across a Large Room that was floored with um that japanese flooring. i probably wandered around a [DonQuijote](ドン・キホーテ) , and a department store, and i also ate Burger King for dinner.

![9.3 16:01 GMT+9: Building](pics/20230903_160125.jpg)

![9.3 16:31 GMT+9: some Youths photographing what i believe to be Pigeon out the Building. before this, i saw them photographing some kind of other Bird on Roof of Building or so. So i assume they were now photographing Pigeon. Usually i feel weird to photograph a Humans, however i liked this Picture.](pics/20230903_163129.jpg)

![9.3 17:13 GMT+9: Burger King: avocado Whopper Jr., chicken nuggets, fries, cola.](pics/20230903_171317.jpg)

![9.3 17:46 GMT+9: i encountered this giant staircase while wandering around. idk why it was there but it was. it led to.. i think an upper level of kyoto station or sth?? i dont really remember](pics/20230903_174618.jpg)

![9.3 17:55 GMT+9: a street around kyoto station](pics/20230903_175504.jpg)

eventually i went to my Booked Hotel. Funny story i got panhandled in kyoto station. i was standing in front of the ticket machine and looking up at the Fare Map to verify that i needed a JPY190 ticket , and an old guy comes up to me and says something in Japanese tbh i dont remember and didnt fully Know what he said , except i made out '[100円](HYAKUEN)' and they was holding out their Ballcap. so i gave them the JPY100 coin i was holding and they probably said thx bro or sth and left and i wondered what just happened then bought my ticket and left.

Anyways i trained and walked to Hotel, where i checked in. I remember this check-in was more awkward than usual. i do not remember the details, but after i finished the process , i turned and walked towards Vending Machines to buy a can of Beer , and the employee that just checked me in and said sth , i think to the effect of "amenities in room"? idk what they meant with that like was there free Beer in room? or were they assuming i was going to buy amenities from the Vending Machines (i dont remember if there were Amenities in the Vending Machines)? im not sure , but i did an "oh ok" and then left to go to my room. This was probably actually Best for my Liver bc i now see that i had been drinking Every Day since Day 2 (or Day 1 if it includes the plane over).

<div class=aside>
### aside: Drinking Ethanol
I do not endorse Ingesting Alcoholic Beverages. Alcohol can be seen around the World in many different Cultures with many different People holding different Attitudes towards Alcohol. Tbh Alcohol seems to be a bit Cringe. Alcohol and the people and customs and traditions surrounding Alcohol may occasionally be Interesting. However the fact that Alcohol is BAD for your Body and often plays a role in Destructive Behaviours Makes me Judge Alcohol as being "Mostly Cringe".

This being said , i did ingest quite a bit of Alcohol on this Trip. However i would like to re-state my assertion that Drinking Alcohol is a Self-Destructive Behaviour that is Overall Cringe.
</div>

The room did not have beer , but it was big and had a nice Bathtub and Kitchen-area and also a whole Washing Machine.

![9.3 21:10 GMT+9: large room](pics/20230903_211008.jpg)

![9.3 21:10 GMT+9: kitchen thing area leading into bathroom. washing machine is behind the picture](pics/20230903_211031.jpg)

i took bath , and then tried out the Washing Machine with a few articles of Clothing because it looked Cool ; it even had a Drying feature (despite being a Washing Machine). However i did not Add Laundry Detergent (bc i didnt have any) , and that Wasn't a good idea bc the edges of the drum got all crusty with laundry grime. Oops!!!. i tried to wash it out by running a cleaning cycle with Shampoo but it didn't really wash out well.

That was awkward so i went to sleep. END OF DAY 8

![Day 8 kyoto paths](pics/japan-8-kyoto.png)

![approx the TRAINS path i followed for DAY 8, japan](pics/japan-8-trains.png)

## japan day 9 -- kyoto

This day , i decided to try to see some older buildings in Kyoto, because an friend that went to Japan once saied that Kyoto has older buildings or so. I trained to an Area where i first ate Matsuya.

![9.4 10:40 GMT+9: yum food!](pics/20230904_104020.jpg)

Then i walked to some kind of area that google maps seemed to promote as a touristy You Can Look At Old Buildings street. I think it was "[花見小路](hanamikoji road)"?. But when i got there it was kind of underwhelming and also it said dont take photographs so i just left.

![9.4 11:25 GMT+9: not the street but neat river and bird and buildings i saw on the way over to the street.](pics/20230904_112554.jpg)

Then i wondered what to do, and so i decided to go to '[吉田寮](yoshida dorm)', an kyoto-university Dormitory that a friend always mentioned whenever i bring up Japan because they thought it looked cool. But before i did that, i stopped by a nearby [Convenience store](familymart) and bought a cold Bottle of Tea and an Umbrella, the Tea to drink and the Umbrella to shield mineself from the Sun. I also walked for like 1 min in some shrine area which had a lot of people walking around.

<div class=aside>
### aside: my umbrella
i initially bought My Umbrella to use as a Parasol. I was thinking in the back of my head for a while whether to buy one or not. here were my concerns:

1. i dont wanna carry that around with me for rest of entire trip
2. I think my surroundings in Life seemed to suggest that using a Parasol was a Feminine concept i.e. Not Very For Those That Identified Themself as an "Male". For example, i remembered that there is "Parasol Lady" NPCs in Pocket-monster Video games, but no "Parasol NotLady". also most of the people carrying around Parasols i saw was Females.

here is how i resolved my concerns

1. there was a very small 98-gram Umbrella so carrying around it shouldnt be much of a problem
2. i told myself again that it is silly to associate something like Being able to carry around an Object with some kind of Larger Identity, Identity is Stupid, Society is Stupid, and also i think i saw some old guys walking out a temple holding Parasols. so i no longer Cared.
3. also i was hot and noticed that Shade made it noticeably Less Hot.

so i bought My Umbrella it served me well during throughout this Trip including the Next Countries.
</div>

I continued on my way to [吉田寮](YOSIDARYOU).

![9.4 12:12 GMT+9: some street](pics/20230904_121216.jpg)

![9.4 12:20 GMT+9: i passed by this vending machine that had this 'CBD' drink. i had read before that CBD is some component in the popular recreational drug 'Mariuana' but does not produce any Altered State Effects by itself. however this drink promised '[新しい世界へ](to new world)' and i was curious so i Bought Drank one. it just tasted like random energy drink or so and i remained firmly in my old world.](pics/20230904_122001.jpg)

![9.4 12:35 GMT+9: cute Birds at a Body of Water](pics/20230904_123515.jpg)

![9.4 12:54 GMT+9: this picture represents that i bought a [Cider](サイダー)-flavoured 'seventeen ice' from a vending machine = plastic tube thing containing sweet Icy Slush thing u squeeze out and Eat. it was yummy. This is the Disposal Bin provided for 'Seventeen Ice' (used packaging). many Ants are crawling on it.](pics/20230904_125418.jpg)

![9.4 12:55 GMT+9: some kind of shrine thing i passed by](pics/20230904_125504.jpg)

finally i arrived at [吉田寮](YOSIDARYOU). It is actually like peoples dormitory so i felt kind of weird visiting it and Did not want to Enter. bc idk if ur even supposed to Enter. i would be kind of weirded out if tourists randomly walked in My university dormitory. so i just took picture of entrance then Walked On.

However i thought: well i may or may not be in Japan for the entire rest of my Life and the Pictures i saw online Did like sort of interesting so maybe i should just take a peek inside ; i maybe sort of look like a potential student and its not like im gonna enter someones actual rooms/building n stuff.

So i walked in and briefly looked around. there looked to be some kind building u had to go in to go further (now that i look at google maps, i think its the actual main dorm building). and there was a guy smoking in front of it and i already felt weird being inside the Walls so i just left.

![9.4 13:14 GMT+9: Yosida Dormitory Enterance](pics/20230904_131455.jpg)

![9.4 13:21 GMT+9: some signs on a door. this seems to be this Dorm's aesthetic/vibe: sort of not cleaning things up and letting them reach a kind of Grungy Natural State.](pics/20230904_132153.jpg)

I then walked [Up](north) and [Right](east). i passed by Kyoto University gates. and then i walked into a Shrine or so right next to the university. It was quite nice because it was Quiet with no people. Then i saw an enticing long stairs up into mountains, so i went up the stairs. and then i walked around a little mountain area it was nice. i eventually walked out the little mountain on the other side, ending up in some kind of residential area.

![9.4 13:43 GMT+9: enticing stairs](pics/20230904_134317.jpg)

![9.4 13:45 GMT+9: cute little mountain area](pics/20230904_134520.jpg)

![9.4 13:53 GMT+9: a random house in the area. i took a few steps past a sign that said dont trespass to take this picture.](pics/20230904_135333.jpg)

![9.4 13:55 GMT+9: a clearing with Rock Seats or so. i sort of expected them to turn into small trolls.](pics/20230904_135527.jpg)

![9.4 14:02 GMT+9: View Coming Down the MountainArea ([吉田山](yoshida mt) facing East)](pics/20230904_140159.jpg)

![9.4 14:12 GMT+9: in Kyoto i started seeing water bottles filled with water around ppls houses n stuff and i was confused why they were there. from a 2 min google search now, it seems to be to keep cats or so away ?](pics/20230904_141202.jpg)

At this point idrked what to do. I looked at Google Maps and saw there was a lot of Shrine/Temple things along the East where the City met the Mountains. So, i decided to Walk down that area, stopping by the ShrineTemples as i went , eventually reaching a Subway station.

So i started by walking to this large Temple thing that even has its own icon on Google Maps, which was led to by this long touristy street. There i used a little gumball gacha machine to get a random Kyoto-souvenir Pin ; tbh i hoped i would get like a Train i think but i ended up getting some kind of Temple that idked.

I then went to the big Temple but you had to Pay to get in so i didnt go in. Instead i started my Southward Walk along an area where City met Mountain. it was ok, but all the ShrineTemple things i passed by there were People noises and People which discouraged me from going in. Instead i just kept walking South.

At one point i took this long detour walking up some street to a random Temple. there was not much to see at the Temple except that i walked a bit into the woods behind the Temple and ran into several Spider webs. Luckily i dont think i physically Touched a spider but i did see some chonky-looking Spiders that idk and i dont really want to k were Venemous or not

![9.4 14:58 GMT+9: detour-shrine (圓重寺) parking lot](pics/20230904_145805.jpg)

![9.4 15:07 GMT+9: poor-quality shot of chonky spider that i luckily did not run into](pics/20230904_150748.jpg)

![9.4 15:13 GMT+9: on the way back West i saw this Warning sign saying that マムシ comes out that area. idked what マムシ was but im guessing it was not something i wanted to run into. looking it up i saw it meant some kinds of Veneomous Snakes.oop!](pics/20230904_151333.jpg)

![9.4 15:16 GMT+9: some person wrote something entitled 'Japanese phylosophy' and put it on both sides of this Sign thing. if u think about it if Y is supposed to the greek I, why is 'philosophy' not (still) spelled 'phylosophy'?? leave a comment if u know below in the comments section below.](pics/20230904_151626.jpg)

Anyways i kept walking South.

![9.4 15:27 GMT+9: a Path](pics/20230904_152708.jpg)

Eventually i reached a place called [南禅寺](NANZENJI-TEMPLE). i do not being very Impressionable except that it had a Bathroom and a Souvenier Coin machine. So i continued on. However on my way out of the area, i came across a sign with an Arrow , and the phrase "Steep and bad path" , pointing to some kind of Shrine or so. how Enticing! it said it would only take 30 Mins as well. So, i headed That Way.

![9.4 15:53 GMT+9: this was the sign. it says "[トレイル](trail)33-3" which im guessing indicated a Hiking Trail , but i dont think i recognised this; [トレイル](trail) kinda looks like [トイレ](toilet) though idk if i thought that it said [トイレ](toilet). i doubt i really thought anything. Also it might seem dumb that i just randomly decided to follow a sign because it said Steep and bad path , but i think I did look at Google Maps and verified that the HIMUKAI-DAIJINGU SHRINE was near a subway station and not just walking into the mountains. but also i am dumb.](pics/20230904_155317.jpg)

This trail was an Experience and probably one of most memorable things i did in Japan. True to the sign, the trail did feel Steep and Bad. however, it was also very Scenic and Serene and also No People.

![9.4 16:07 GMT+9: how scenic! it often feeled like one wrong step could send u tumbling down Steep Mountainside maybe breaking a few Bones as you went. And tearing up ur skin if u were wearing Short pants and Short sleeves as i was haha.](pics/20230904_160729.jpg)

![9.4 16:22 GMT+9: i dont think i captured it well in pictures, but some of the Inclines were kind of scary, especially Downward ones. i was slightly scared i was going to snap an ankle or something descending them with my Socks and Crocs.](pics/20230904_162236.jpg)

![9.4 16:27 GMT+9: stairs leading down to my Destination Shrine](pics/20230904_162659.jpg)

I eventually reached my Destination , an Shrine. the Shrine was nice , it was all up in the Mountain Forest so it was very Peaceful and Cool and Nice and Nobody there , except one person i passed by once on my way out that said Hello and i hopefully i think tried to greet them with my Body Language but idk how successful i was with that.

I then walked to nearby Subway station and took Trains to [Osaka](大阪) ([蹴上](17:09) [->](48) [京都](17:57), [京都](17:58) [->](59) [大阪](18:57)).　I had a bit of a trouble getting from 蹴上 to [Kyoto](京都) station bc didnt know where to transfer. Also at Kyoto station it seemed like there was an Express train to [大阪](OOSAKA).. but at a platform different from the one that was labelled "to oosaka"?? which confused me. So i ended up taking a local train to oosaka, however midway i decided it was too slow and wanted to take the Express train. So i got of at a transferable station and Went to the Express train (which for reference Was on a Different Platform).

![9.4 17:15 GMT+9: nice upholstery on the Kyoto subway. i dont have any pics of Train from Kyoto to Oosaka btw.](pics/20230904_171537.jpg)

I arrived in OOSAKA. tbh it just felt like generic City. but one thing i noticed was that People occasionally Crossed Crosswalks even when they were Red , which i did not observe in Tokyo.

![9.4 19:30 GMT+9: oosaka](pics/20230904_193007.jpg)

I decided to Walk to my Hotel bc i was planning to stop by a Matsuya on the way to Eat Dinner , and if i do that im basically already At the Nearest Train Station To Hotel. So, i went to a Matsuya. However looking into the Window, the vibes seemed very Off , like it was some kind of Bar where Groups of people were Standing around Tables. That was kind of terrifying , so i went to a Different one which looked more Normal.

However after I Ordered at the Kiosk i noticed Something was Off . There was like someone Coming Around Serving customers or something Bringing over Food or something???? , and then someone Came Over to my Table , and then Took my Tickets and Ripped them and Went Away. it was a bit Unfamiliar and Scary tbh , but i sat there and waited , and then they brang over Food and i Ate it. and then from what i observe , you just Leave ur stuff at table and someone would come over and clean it up. so i did that. and left.

![9.4 19:41 GMT+9: [ハンバーグカレー](hamburg curry)大盛 and [豚汁半熟玉子セット](tonjiru and half-cooked egg set). i tend to be picky with Curry and tbh i didnt really like this Curry; it was my least-fav food i had in japan i think. the Tonjiru i dont really remember bc all i remember was the Curry that i Didnt really like.](pics/20230904_194109.jpg)

I walked to hotel , on the way stopped by a [Convenience](store) and bought a bag of shrimp snack and some Beer. at the Hotel i took a Bath and then enjoyed a Snack while observing what was being broadcasted onto the Television. I accidentally spilled the bag of Shrimp Snack because i hit it with my Phone Charging Cable. However luckily much of it landed on some Clothes i had on a chair , which i felt comfortable eating off of. Thus i only lost about , according to a picture i took, around 28 puffed Shrimp Snacks. The beer tastes were not very Noteworthy.

The hotel room , which i dont have any good pictures of, was not particularly noteworthy. It was clean and did not have any bad smells iirc, and was only USD23.85 (booked night before) and had a Bathtub and was in the City so i was satisfied. i do not really remember what i did at the Hotel in the Night besides snack , observe Television, charge phone, probably brush Teeth and go to Bed.

END OF DAY 9

## japan day 10 -- osaka

Today was my basically my Last Day in Japan. I decided to spend the day 'Shopping'. but first , i ate Wendy's. here was my Wendy's Order.

- [博多明太子味ポテト](hakata-mentaiko-flavoured french fries)L
- [チキンナゲット](chicken nugget) + [サルサソース](salsa sauce)
- [ﾒｷｼｶﾝｱﾎﾞｶﾄﾞﾊﾞｰｶﾞｰ](mexican avocado burger)
- [ウェンディーズチリ](wendy's chili)M
- [メロンソーダ](melon soda)M

![9.5 10:43 GMT+9: the spread](pics/20230905_104300.jpg)

![9.5 10:43 GMT+9: the burger](pics/20230905_104342.jpg)

the food was good ig it tasted about like what was expected. the overall Visit i remember felt a bit awkward though , When my order came out the person said sth about chicken nuggets and i dont think i understood and then they said something in english about chicken nuggets havent come out or sth so sit down and we will bring them to u and i tried to communicate sth like "no its ok i can wait i want to wait bc i dont want to have someone come over" (which i probably communicated by saying sth like "Wait") and then they replied sth like "no just sit down bro" so i sat down staring at my food and then someone came over and gave me my chicken nuggets. and then i decided to sit upstairs, but the only nonawkward spot to sit seemed to be right near the bathrooms , which u could smell. so i went to the Upstairs Upstairs which had absolutely nobody which was nice ig, except one time when someone came up and went into employee room and ig got ready to work and came out and went back downstairs, which doesn't really contain any inherent awkwardness but idk i kind of felt weird Knowing that the Person walked up three flights of stairs to see someone eating alone in the very top floor of a Wendy's, but it was probably just a very normal Day in the Life for them ig. my vibe was also sort of depressing bc someone told me sth like "osaka is known for good food places u should go to some hehe" and i said yeah haha ok and then went to Wendy's bc i was too afraid to try anything else and potentially talk to an irl human.

after finishing my Wendy's i basically just walked around 'Shopping' for the rest of the day. there were very large Commercial areas lots of People in these covered sort of Outlet Mall things , and there were Department Stores, etc. i searched for a while to find this very specific little [赤べこ](akabeko) bobblehead cow gacha machine that i had encountered once before and thought would be a nice souvenir for an Family member. i Found it. i Browsed around more just for fun. i used like two other Gacha machines bc i figured i wasnt going to come back to Japan (at least in a while) so go Crazy. also stopped by the good ol [無印良品](muji) and bought socks (both the pairs i had brought had large holes in them by now), some nifty charging-cable retainers that i had seen earlier, and a small notebook and pen which i planned to used to record Details of my Travels but Wrote In Twice And Never Used Again.

Overall not very exciting ; no opportunities to get Rabies or Snap my Ankle. the most memorable thing was maybe guy that was busking(?) by posing as spiderman statue(?) and had a sign saying (in both japanese and english) that their dream was to open restaurant.

![9.5 13:03 GMT+9: some kind of side-street that i didnt actually walk down i just took the picture , turned around, and left iirc.](pics/20230905_130354.jpg)

![9.5 15:11 GMT+9: one of the big indoor outlet malls thing](pics/20230905_151150.jpg)

to get to my Dinner Place, i took a little walk by some [tower](通天閣) and a surrounding commercial area , and through a park.

![9.5 17:12 GMT+9: some random street(?) that i took a picture of but did not enter](pics/20230905_171232.jpg)

finally i arrived at my Dinner: matsuya!!! hooray i love matsuya.

![9.5 17:30 GMT+9: my dinner. i dont have exact names of the things bc half of the name is hidden underneath tray but it was essentially grilled pork meat and [norikimu](のりキム). very yummy. a funny episode was that the worker ripped the tickets a bit off on the bottom as u can see and they were like 🤔🤔hmm oop! it was a hmm oop moment tbh.](pics/20230905_173037.jpg)

after dinner i wandered back Home stopping by a [donqui](ドンキー) to buy nothing and a [convenience](store) to buy beer and salad-flavoured [jagarico](じゃがりこ). I wrote proudly in my notes that night that That [convenience](store) checkout was perhaps the longest and most involved checkout experience i had had Yet in japan while feeling Comfortable (it involved responding negatively to "do you need a bag", and then showing my Credit card and them saying "Card" and me responding affirmatively or so and paying with Card.)

![9.5 19:15 GMT+9: good ol DonQui Jote. i went into many and was mentally stimulated by them but never bought anything.](pics/20230905_191507.jpg)

Back at the Hotel i Washed myself and ate my Snacks. The hotel room was slightly nicer than usual (idk if this is bc i payed more [USD 34.95] and so i wanted to think it was nicer); it came with free Bottled Water and had a little plastic Protector around the TV remote, and the Bathroom had a slightly-larger-than-average bathtub. however it was quite Hot and i couldnt find an air-conditioning remote, and the information on the TV system thing said sth like "we cant change individual room climate sorry bro", so i assumed there was no personal air-conditioning? and maybe my room was just Hot because it was right next to a large Hole opening to the neighbouring Empty Construction Lot. I was Sweating it was pretty hot and i figured i was just going to have a very sweatful sleep , until i went to turn off the lights via some kind of Digital Panel next to the bed and notice there was a Temperature Control on it . which controlled the Airconditioning. oops! i turned it on and it was cool and i went to bed.  END OF DAY 10

![9.5 19:27 GMT+9: my room was next to a large hole that opened to an empty land.](pics/20230905_192711.jpg)

![approx where i went in JAPAN DAY 10](pics/japan-10.png)

## japan day 11 -- KIX

my Flight to Taiwan was at 8:55 this morning departing from KIX ; i searched up approx train trip time night before and woke up at 5:30 , took Trains and arrived at 7:16. Note on trains: i saw one train called 'Rapi:t β'(?) which traveled where i needed it to travel, however they had some kind of Ticket Machines for it? within the station? so i assumed it was more Expensive you have to buy an Extra ticket to ride it, so i did not ride it when it arrived (many other people that looked like they were going to the airport Also did not ride it, so i felt safe not riding it).

Checkin at airport was stand in a line and then talk to a person. It turns out i couldn't Check In without a Future plane ticket Out of Taiwan (proof of onward flight?), which was awkward bc i didnt have one. so i left, sat on floor , booked a flight from Taiwan to South Korea, and returned to the Desk where the person directed me back to the same Counter and Finished the Checkin.

the Airport security was very chill ; there were no large person-scanning XRAY machines (just Metal Detectors or so) and you didnt have to take off shoes. i was through there in no time !!

i bought rice balls and bottle of Tea from [convenience](store) at my gate , and then sat on my phone watching youtube . I almost missed my boarding because i had earphones in and was sitting kind of far away from my gate, with my back towards it. I only noticed when looking at my phone time in the corner that boarding time was Now ; i turned around and saw the entire gate waiting area was Empty ; and i jogged over to the boarding as they were literally calling my name bro where are u.

END OF JAPAN
